This docs codebase uses Mintlify.

When adding a new page, make sure to create the .mdx file and also add the page to [docs.json](mdc:docs.json).

# Testing

You can run the dev server using `npx mintlify dev` (if it's not already running). This starts the local dev server at localhost:3000.

You can use the playwright MCP server to test the docs site locally.
