This docs codebase uses Mintlify.

When adding a new page, make sure to create the .mdx file and also add the page to [docs.json](mdc:docs.json).

# Testing

You can run the dev server using `mintlify dev` (if it's not already running). This starts the local dev server at localhost:3000.

You can use the playwright MCP server to test the docs site locally.

# Style guide

Pages typically should not include an h1 at the start of the content since they already use the title from the frontmatter as an h1.

Use sentence case everywhere, never title case. This includes for page names, titles, headers, etc. Example:
Good: "Connect your data"
Bad: "Connect Your Data"

Icons use Font Awesome. For example, 'comments', 'database', 'book-open'.

# Data sources

We have a page for each of the data sources we support in Basedash in `/data-sources/connectors`. You can manually edit the markdown files here, but you also need to update [ignored-connectors.js](mdc:scripts/ignored-connectors.js) so that the script to generate connector pages doesn't overwrite your changes.
