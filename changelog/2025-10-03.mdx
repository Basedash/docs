## Databricks as a data source

You can now connect Databricks as a data source. Point Basedash at your Databricks SQL warehouse and start querying right away. This expands support for enterprise data stacks and makes it easier to bring Databricks datasets into dashboards and AI workflows.

Connection uses your Databricks workspace URL and SQL warehouse credentials. Once connected, tables appear alongside your other sources in the Data tab.

## Mobile navigation: "More" menu for account and org actions

We've added a "More" menu in mobile navigation so it's easy to log out and switch organizations from your phone. This addresses the prior limitation where these actions were hard to access on smaller screens.

The result is a more complete and predictable mobile experience across accounts and orgs.

## Data tab: Fivetran connectors now visible

Fivetran connectors are now shown directly in the Data tab, making it simpler to see which sources are synced through Fivetran and how they relate to your other data.
