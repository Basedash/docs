## Smarter dashboard defaults

We now remember your last-used date range and grouping choices on dashboards. When you come back, those controls will auto-populate with what you used most recently, making it faster to pick up where you left off and keep analyses consistent across sessions.

## Self-hosting email providers (coming soon)

We introduced a new email system for our upcoming self-hosted functionality that supports multiple providers. This gives organizations options to configure the provider that fits their infrastructure and adds resilience with the ability to set fallbacks if our primary service has an outage.

## Fixes and improvements

- Fixed an issue where chart errors didn’t display properly on public dashboards, and added an edit button when you have permission.
- Fixed an issue where the date range behaved incorrectly on the new shared (v2) dashboard route.
- Fixed an issue where public dashboard variables were filtered out unexpectedly.
- Improved bar chart rendering with better axis labels and spacing.
