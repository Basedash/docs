New data source picker in AI chart input, unified org/user menu, and auto-filtering of soft-deleted rows. Plus a suite of chat UX fixes including input, sorting, gaps, and abort improvements.

## Unified account and organization menu

We've combined the organization switcher and user dropdown into a single, streamlined menu. Logout now lives in the Profile command menu route (and remains available from the global command menu), reducing duplication and simplifying navigation.

## Cleaner data browsing with soft-deleted rows filtered by default

The data page now automatically filters out soft-deleted records. This keeps views tidy and reduces the chance of confusion or acting on deprecated data, improving day-to-day clarity for data exploration.

## Fixes and improvements

- Removed the "New chart from prompt" command; use the global AI chat panel instead.
- Fixed blank spacing causing extra "thinking" rows in chats.
- Chat input now expands vertically again.
- Resolved gaps in chat messages so conversations appear continuously.
- Stopping AI chat now reliably stops generation and restores the prior prompt.
- Global chat sidebar opens by default for quicker access.
