## Control access to each data source (admin-managed)

You can now restrict who can query specific data sources inside an organization. Admins can grant access to "everyone", specific groups, or specific people—while keeping existing orgs fully backwards-compatible (if you don't configure grants, nothing changes).

This makes it much easier to onboard teammates safely (especially in larger orgs) without needing to split work across separate workspaces or duplicate connections.

## Sharing & embed experiences are cleaner and more intuitive

Dashboard sharing permissions were streamlined into a clearer, single permissions list (instead of an "Everyone/Restricted" toggle), with improved behavior when multiple permission types overlap.

And for teams running Basedash in full-app embed mode, share menus are now hidden throughout the app—keeping embedded experiences focused and reducing "wait, should I click that?" confusion.

## Fixes and improvements

- Added data-source access filtering across the product (so you only see/query what you have access to).
- Added an empty state in the chat sidebar when no chats match your current filter.
- Added an option to copy a chart's SQL.
- Displayed Stripe discounts on the upgrade page (when a discount applies).
- Improved dashboard grid responsiveness.
- Fixed the filter popover opening automatically.
- Fixed the "Reset" button behavior on table views.
- Prevented empty SQL queries from running.
- Fixed "Copy as PNG" exports clipping dashboard metrics.
- Fixed metric layout overflow in some views.
- Improved sharing dialog layout to prevent overflow in tight widths.
- Added an SMTP "From email" field to self-hosted system settings (so admins don't have to rely on an env var alone).
