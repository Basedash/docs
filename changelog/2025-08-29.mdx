## Chat navigation overhaul: right-side list + full-screen chats

We moved the chats list to the right sidebar to match the main app's layout and improve focus on results. You can also open individual chats in a full-screen view for deeper exploration without distractions. This makes navigating between chats faster and more consistent with the rest of the product.

## Private or shared chats, with a simple toggle

You now have clear control over who can see a chat. A new Share button lets you set chats to private or shared at any time, and your sidebar filter for private/shared chats persists across sessions. New chats respect your current filter selection, so you're always creating in the mode you expect.

## Charts in chat: add to dashboards, export, and copy as PNG

Turning insights into assets is quicker: charts generated in chat can be added directly to a dashboard (existing or new), copied as a PNG, or exported. We also refined chart sizing and frames so results feel more readable. When sending answers to Slack or email, interactive charts are disabled to avoid confusion and ensure the message comes through cleanly.

## Data page: table context menus

Right-click context menus are now available on tables in the Data page, making it faster to access common actions like filtering, sorting, and copying.
