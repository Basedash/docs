## Insights & Alerts (formerly Autopilot)

Autopilot has been split into two clearer, user-facing concepts: **Insights** and **Alerts**. Insights are AI-generated, editorial-style updates that surface what changed in your data (with supporting charts) and can be delivered via email and Slack, so teams can stay in sync without constantly building new reporting.

Alongside the new structure, the Insights UI has been hardened (including a fix for an Insights page crash), and notification preferences can be configured per organization.

## Chart drilldowns

Charts now support **drilldowns**—click on a bar, point, or segment and immediately see the underlying records in a table. This makes it much faster to answer "what's driving this?" without rewriting SQL or creating a separate detail chart.

Drilldowns work across common chart types (including bar, line, pie, maps, and more), and Basedash automatically generates the drilldown query so it's available even when charts are created quickly.

## Embedding & API keys available to everyone

Full app embedding and API keys are no longer hidden behind feature gating—all teams can now discover and use them directly from settings.

This makes it easier to roll out Basedash inside your product or internal tooling and build workflows around the platform without needing special enablement.

## Zero data-retention support for AI

Basedash now supports a **stateless / zero data retention** mode for AI where required, enabling teams with stricter privacy or compliance needs to use AI features without retaining conversation state in the same way as standard mode.

## Fixes and improvements

- Fixed the command menu showing incorrect results when typing immediately after opening it.
- Added automatic client-side retries for temporary 502/503 errors (with a "reconnecting" experience) to reduce disruption during brief outages or deploys.
- Kept the chat panel open when switching back to Ask mode so the UI doesn't unexpectedly collapse.
- Added support for custom fiscal calendars so time-based reporting can align with your fiscal year.
- Added a new progress chart visualization.
- Improved scatter plots by fixing resizing/legend layout issues and refining dot styling.
- Fixed the "Yesterday" date range behavior.
- Improved dashboard editing visuals by fixing separator sizing in edit mode.
- Improved connector icon loading by serving Fivetran icons via CDN for faster page loads.
- Improved ClickHouse schema introspection compatibility by using system tables (helpful for more hosted ClickHouse providers).
