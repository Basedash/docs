## Archive reports with a "Recently deleted" view

You can now archive reports. Archived items are moved to a "Recently deleted" section, helping you keep workspaces tidy without losing context. This follows the same archiving model we use for dashboards and charts for a consistent cleanup workflow.

## Clearer partial data in time series charts

Time series charts now use dashed lines and bars to indicate partial periods (for example, the current day or month). This makes it obvious when a data point is still in progress and helps prevent misreads of incomplete data. We also shipped a small performance improvement when rendering these partial series.

## Faster AI chat with database schema caching

We added a database schema cache so we no longer re-fetch large schema metadata every time you start a chat. In local tests, this shaved about 1–2 seconds off responses on cache hits, with bigger gains on larger databases, while also reducing load on the database.
