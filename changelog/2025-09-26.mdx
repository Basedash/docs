## Unified account and organization menu

We've combined the organization switcher and user dropdown into a single, streamlined menu. Logout now lives in the Profile command menu route (and remains available from the global command menu), reducing duplication and simplifying navigation.

## Cleaner data browsing with soft-deleted rows filtered by default

The data page now automatically filters out soft-deleted records. This keeps views tidy and reduces the chance of confusion or acting on deprecated data, improving day-to-day clarity for data exploration.

## Fixes and improvements

- Removed the "New chart from prompt" command; use the global AI chat panel instead.
- Fixed blank spacing that caused extra "thinking" rows in chats.
- Restored vertical expansion for the chat input.
- Resolved gaps in chat messages so conversations appear continuously.
- Fixed an issue where stopping AI chat didn’t reliably stop generation or restore the prior prompt.
- Made the global chat sidebar open by default for quicker access.
