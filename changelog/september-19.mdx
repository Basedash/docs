Shipped a new System Settings UI for self-hosted instances and a simpler SMTP setup with test emails. Plus UI improvements and fixes across onboarding and connectors.

## Self-hosted deployment updates

- We introduced a System Settings UI that centralizes configuration (like email and AI providers) in-app for self-hosted instances. This reduces reliance on environment variables and makes setup and ongoing administration much simpler.
- Access is limited to admins on self-hosted instances. While the first iteration focuses on foundational structure, it sets the stage for more configuration options to be managed directly in the app.

## Simpler SMTP configuration with test emails

- SMTP setup is now more forgiving for self-hosted deployments. Authentication is optional when no username/password is provided, and TLS behavior is handled more explicitly to support local/dev testing scenarios.
- A test email tool lets you validate templates and configuration end-to-end, improving confidence in email delivery before going live.

## Improved Fivetran connector onboarding

We improved the connector onboarding flow to make it easier to connect new data sources through Fivetran, with clearer status indicators and better error handling.
