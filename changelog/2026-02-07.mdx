## Refresh and organize charts faster

You can now refresh data for a single chart directly from the chart menu—handy when you're iterating on one view and don't want to refresh an entire dashboard.

We also made chart renaming feel much more lightweight: click the chart title in the header to rename it right in place, so keeping dashboards tidy is a lot quicker.

## Stay in flow while AI works

Basedash can now send desktop notifications when AI finishes, so you can switch tabs (or step away) and still know exactly when results are ready.

We also added clearer loading states while chat messages are loading, making conversations feel more responsive—especially on slower connections or when opening longer threads.

## Fixes and improvements

- Fixed dashboards briefly showing older cached data after a refresh/reload.
- Improved how AI formats percentage values so results read correctly as 0–100% (instead of 0–1).
- Improved AI SQL generation across dialects with clearer dialect-specific guidance.
- Improved reliability of AI query execution by automatically correcting certain tool-call errors.
- Improved stability of live streaming updates for chats and chart runs (long-lived connections now recover more gracefully).
- Reduced duplicate/overlapping data sync runs (including debouncing repeated manual sync clicks).
- Made periodic data syncing more consistent by moving it fully server-side.
- Improved scheduled report reliability and scalability so reports are less likely to miss runs under load.
- Fixed a background job edge case that could cause intermittent failures.
