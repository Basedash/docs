## Basedash Autopilot

Today we’re excited to introduce Autopilot, the next evolution of Basedash.

Autopilot is an AI agent that proactively analyzes your data, finds the most important insights, and automatically surfaces them to your team.

Autopilot is a major upgrade to Reports, a beta feature many of our customers have been using for the past few months.

What began as a simple scheduled summary tool has grown into something far more powerful: an autonomous, always-on partner that helps you understand what’s happening in your business… and why.

## 2025 Wrapped

We added a new “2025 Wrapped”, which lets you generate a summary of the year’s key insights for your company.

Try it out by clicking the new “2025 Wrapped” prompt in chat and share what your company achieved this year!

## Fixes and improvements

- Streamlined the onboarding “Connect a data source” flow to feel simpler and clearer.
- Fixed PostHog tracking during onboarding.
- Improved Slack-delivered report rendering for long content, especially when tables are involved, so messages stay readable.
- Fixed an issue where clicking a report could open the wrong report.
- Fixed an issue where chat-generated charts could spin forever instead of showing an error when something goes wrong.
- Fixed uneven and oversized bars in grouped vertical bar charts.
- Improved table column resizing so widened columns reveal more text with less aggressive truncation.
- Added scrolling to long submenus so actions don’t get stuck off-screen.
- Improved resilience around transient query failures (for example, network issues and 502s) so things recover more gracefully.
