## Public API: create and manage orgs + data sources

We've expanded the Public API so you can automate more of your Basedash setup and maintenance. You can now create, fetch, and update organizations; upload an organization image; and manage embedding-related org settings via API.

On the data side, the Public API now supports creating, updating, and fetching data sources, plus verifying connection credentials before saving anything—making it much easier to build "test connection" flows into your own tooling. We also added a machine-readable API spec and introduced rate limiting to keep integrations predictable and stable at scale.

## Full-app embedding: safer setup, clearer failures, better iframe support

Embedding setup is now configurable directly in-app, with controls to enable/disable full-app embedding per org and manage allowed embed origins. This makes it much easier for teams to roll out secure embeds without guessing configuration details.

We also made embedded sign-in flows more robust and user-friendly: embeds now enforce origin allowlists more consistently, show clearer in-embed error pages when something goes wrong, and behave more reliably in iframe contexts. For teams provisioning users via JWT SSO, you can now optionally assign a role through the JWT when creating new members.

## Dashboards: auto-rotating tabs + a more polished tab UI

Dashboards can now automatically rotate through tabs on a timer—useful for wall displays, team TVs, or hands-off monitoring views.

We also refreshed the tabs UI to feel more consistent and clickable, and improved navigation so saving a chart brings you back to the correct dashboard tab.

## Data sources & onboarding: PostHog support + a smoother connection flow

PostHog is now available as a first-class data source, so you can query event-level analytics directly in Basedash. Connecting PostHog is also simpler with a region selector that fits how most teams actually deploy (while still supporting self-hosted setups).

Separately, we streamlined the onboarding/connection flow and reduced confusion around connection health states—so it's clearer when something is truly unhealthy vs. "still syncing."

## Fixes and improvements

- Added PostHog as a direct data source you can query.
- Simplified the data source connection and onboarding experience.
- Added dashboard tab auto-rotation for hands-free monitoring displays.
- Refreshed dashboard tab styling and interaction.
- Improved navigation so saving a chart returns you to the correct dashboard tab.
- Preserved exact chart queries when adding charts from chat to dashboards (reducing "surprise" changes).
- Improved report email recipient management (add/remove recipients more easily, including external emails).
- Prevented running Autopilot reports with missing instructions.
- Auto-named reports after the first run (instead of leaving "Start from scratch").
- Improved recurring report quality by using summaries of previous runs as context.
- Showed the last successful chart results when a refresh fails (instead of blanking the chart).
- Sped up data exports by avoiding unnecessary count queries.
- Fixed cases where charts could render blank unexpectedly.
- Fixed bar chart ordering issues when breakdown data is incomplete.
- Improved currency label spacing for multi-character symbols in bar charts.
- Clarified data source status when a connection is unhealthy.
- Tightened permissions and reduced accidental overwrites when making bulk dashboard/chart updates.
- Improved chat UI layout so content doesn't shift and feedback controls stay visible.
- Reduced visual clutter by auto-collapsing long "context updated" callouts.
- Removed duplicate "API keys" entries in the profile menu.
