## Reorderable dashboards

Reorder dashboards to fit your flow. You can now drag-and-drop dashboards to set the order that works best for your team. Keep your most important dashboards up front and streamline navigation so everyone can find what they need faster.

## Multi-select variables

Richer chart interactivity with multi-select variables. Charts now support multi-select variables, making it easier to compare multiple segments or filters at once. This adds flexibility for building side-by-side analyses without juggling separate dashboards or views.

## Pie chart legends

Pie charts now include legends, making it easier to understand what each segment represents without hovering.

## Onboarding improvements

Smoother first-time experience and sign-in. We've polished onboarding and sign-in. If you sign up with Google, non-verified emails can authenticate via a one-time passcode. New users without an organization will be guided to set company details in the first step, reducing friction and clarifying setup.
