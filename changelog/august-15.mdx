Upgraded to GPT-5 for improved reasoning and response clarity, introduced organization-level custom AI context for tailored responses, added a one-click copy feature for chat messages, and implemented various fixes and improvements.

## Upgraded AI engine to GPT-5

We've upgraded both the chat and chart agents to GPT-5. You should see stronger reasoning, clearer responses, and more reliable tool use across multi-step tasks and longer conversations.

Behind the scenes this also improves how context carries across turns, resulting in more consistent follow-ups and better alignment with your intent.

## Organization-level custom AI context

You can now define a custom AI context for your workspace. Use it to teach the AI your preferred terminology, data nuances, or response style so answers better reflect your organization.

This setting is available from the organization switcher and in Settings. Once configured, the chat and chart agents will take your context into account by default.

## One-click copy for chat messages

Every chat message now includes a dedicated Copy button, making it quick to share answers with teammates or reuse snippets elsewhere without losing formatting.

## Fixes and improvements

- Improved chart rendering performance for large datasets.
- Fixed edge cases in date range filtering.
- Better error messages when database connections fail.
