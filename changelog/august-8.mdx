New features include smarter dashboard defaults that remember last-used settings, and an upcoming email system for self-hosting that supports multiple providers.

## Smarter dashboard defaults

We now remember your last-used date range and grouping choices on dashboards. When you come back, those controls will auto-populate with what you used most recently, making it faster to pick up where you left off and keep analyses consistent across sessions.

## Self-hosting email providers (coming soon)

We introduced a new email system for our upcoming self-hosted functionality that supports multiple providers. This gives organizations options to configure the provider that fits their infrastructure and adds resilience with the ability to set fallbacks if our primary service has an outage.

## Fixes and improvements

- Fixed: Chart errors now display properly on public dashboards, with an edit button shown when you have permission.
- Fixed: Date range on the new shared (v2) dashboard route now behaves correctly.
- Fixed: Public dashboard variables are no longer filtered out unexpectedly.
- Improved bar chart rendering with better axis labels and spacing.
