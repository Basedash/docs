Shipped a global AI sidebar, rolled out a new OTP login flow, and improved Reports onboarding with auto-created reports and clearer status. Also delivered chat UI polish and stability improvements.

## Global AI sidebar

A new global AI sidebar is now available across the app, making assistance just a click away wherever you are. The chat list is collapsible and there's a floating sidebar variant so you can keep working while chatting. When you navigate between pages, your selected chat now stays open in context for a smoother flow.

We also tightened up the sidebar experience with scroll reliability, better spacing, and visual refinements to "thinking" states so the interface feels faster and more consistent.

## New OTP login flow

We've introduced a one-time passcode (OTP) login option for a faster, more reliable sign-in experience. The OTP screens have been refreshed to be clearer and more consistent with the rest of the product.

Alongside the new flow, we fixed an issue where magic links could fail if you were already logged in, improving reliability for link-based sign-ins.

## Reports onboarding and clarity

New workspaces now automatically get a "Daily insight" report with email alerts enabled, so you start seeing value without setup. If you don't want it, you can always remove or customize it later.
