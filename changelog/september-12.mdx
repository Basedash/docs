Charts in Chat is now enabled for everyone, the chat sidebar is integrated and resizable (no more floating panel), and we shipped a wave of chat polish and security updates.

## Charts in Chat for everyone

You can now generate and work with charts directly from Chat across the app. While viewing a dashboard, adding a chart from the global chat instantly pins it to your current dashboard—making it faster to capture insights without context switching.

We also smoothed the reading experience in chat with cleaner table rendering and streaming of final assistant replies so long answers don't "jump" when they finish.

## Redesigned chat sidebar: integrated and resizable

The chat sidebar is now part of the main layout and can be resized to fit your workspace. The previous floating panel has been removed, giving a more predictable, space-efficient workflow and consistent sizing across chat contexts.

## Fixes and improvements

- Chat: Show a loader in the sidebar when a chat is generating.
- Security hardening across authentication and session handling.
- Improved stability for real-time sync connections.
