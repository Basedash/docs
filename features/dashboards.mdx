Basedash dashboards help you organize and share your data visualizations in one place. Create interactive dashboards that update in real-time and share them with your team.

## Creating a new dashboard

1. Click "+ Dashboard" from your Basedash workspace
2. Give your dashboard a name
3. Start creating charts using AI

## Managing your dashboard

### Layout and organization
- Resize and arrange charts by dragging
- Group related metrics together
- Add markdown text blocks for context
- Create sections with headers

### Filters
- Add dashboard-wide filters
- Create date range selectors
- Filter by specific dimensions
- Apply filters to multiple charts

### Auto-refresh
By default, dashboards refresh every 5 minutes to keep your data up-to-date. You can change the refresh interval to fit your needs.

## Sharing and collaboration

You can share the dashboards you create with your team members in Basedash, or with the public. You have full control over who can view and edit the dashboard.

### Permission levels

Here are the different access levels you can assign to groups on your dashboard:

- Full access: Ability to do anything on a dashboard, including changing access levels.
- Edit access: Ability to edit dashboard properties or charts on a dashboard. You cannot change access levels.
- View access: You can only view charts on a dashboard.
- No access: Cannot view a dashboard.

By default, when you create a new dashboard, everyone will have full access. The dashboard creator will always have full access to a dashboard.

### Restricted access

If you don't want to give everyone access to a dashboard, you can select the "Restricted" option which lets you specify access for groups on a dashboard.

<img
  className="block mx-auto"
  src="/images/dashboard-org-access.png"
  alt="Dashboard org access"
  width="300"
/>

Admins can create groups and manage group members from the command menu.

### Public dashboards

You can share dashboards outside of Basedash by enabling "Publish to web" in the dashboard share menu. This will create a public URL that you can share with anyone to view the dashboard. The public link does not require a Basedash account to view, and only allows viewing data, not editing.

You can control the color theme of the public dashboard, and enterprise users can optionally hide Basedash branding.

### Embedding dashboards

You can embed dashboards in your own website or app by using the public URL. This will allow you to share the dashboard with your audience, wherever they are.

We also support controlling filter values when embedding dashboards. This allows you to share a dashboard with your audience, and control the data that is shown for each user. Contact us for more information on how to set this up.
