Basedash's reports feature allows you to create AI-powered scheduled reports that automatically analyze your data and generate insights on a regular basis. Instead of manually creating reports, you can set up automated reports that run on your schedule and deliver valuable insights directly to your team.

## How it works

The AI analyzes your data based on your specific requirements and automatically generates comprehensive reports. You can configure reports to run daily, weekly, or monthly, and have them delivered via email or Slack notifications.

The AI can access data from any data sources you have connected to Basedash, including your own databases, SaaS applications, and more. See our full list of [data sources here](/data-sources/introduction).

## Example use cases

Reports can be tailored to your specific business needs:

- **Weekly status updates**: Get a comprehensive overview of everything happening at your company
- **Daily user tracking**: Monitor new user signups and engagement metrics
- **Automated changelogs**: Generate changelogs based on your GitHub PRs that have been merged recently
- **Sales performance**: Track revenue, conversion rates, and sales team performance
- **Customer insights**: Analyze customer behavior, retention, and satisfaction metrics
- **Operational metrics**: Monitor system performance, errors, and usage patterns

## Templates and customization

Get started quickly with our built-in templates, or create completely custom reports from scratch:

- **Pre-built templates**: Choose from a variety of common business report templates
- **Custom reports**: Build reports tailored to your specific data and requirements

## Scheduling options

Configure your reports to run automatically on the schedule that works best for your team:

- **Daily**: Perfect for monitoring key metrics that change frequently (e.g., daily sales numbers, new user signups, website traffic)
- **Weekdays**: Ideal for operational metrics that change throughout the day (e.g., system performance, customer support tickets, server uptime)
- **Weekly**: Ideal for status updates and trend analysis (e.g., team performance, project progress, weekly active users)
- **Monthly**: Great for high-level business reviews and strategic insights (e.g., monthly recurring revenue, customer acquisition cost, churn rate)
- **Quarterly**: Useful for tracking long-term trends and reviewing progress toward strategic goals (e.g., quarterly growth metrics, strategic KPIs, market share analysis)

## Notifications and delivery

Stay informed when your reports are ready:

- **Slack alerts**: Get notified in your team channels when reports are completed
- **Email delivery**: Receive the full report directly in your inbox
- **Multiple recipients**: Share reports with specific team members or entire departments
- **Flexible formatting**: Reports are delivered in clean, readable formats optimized for each channel

## Getting started

To create your first report, navigate to the reports section in your Basedash dashboard. Create a new report by choosing from our template library or start from scratch, configure your instructions, set your preferred schedule, and choose your notification preferences.

The AI will handle the complexity of data analysis and report generation, ensuring you get actionable insights without the manual effort of traditional reporting.

You can control everything from which data sources to use, to the format of the report, by editing the instructions.
