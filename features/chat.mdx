Basedash's chat interface allows you to have natural conversations with your data using AI. Instead of writing complex SQL queries or creating charts manually, you can simply ask questions in plain English and get instant insights.

## How it works

Navigate to the chat interface in your Basedash dashboard and type your question about your data in natural language. The AI will analyze your question, understand your data schema, and generate the appropriate SQL queries automatically.

Results are presented in the most suitable format to best communicate the answer to your question. We're working on expanding the chat interface to also support compelx charts and dashboards.

## Example questions

You can ask questions like:

- "Show me the trend of new user signups over the last 6 months"
- "What are our top 10 customers by revenue this year?"
- "Compare product sales across different regions"
- "Calculate the average order value by customer segment"
- "Find customers who haven't made a purchase in the last 30 days"

## Advanced analysis

The chat interface isn't limited to simple queries. You can perform complex analysis including cohort analysis, customer segmentation, retention metrics, funnel analysis, and anomaly detection. Simply describe what you want to analyze, and AI will handle the complexity of writing the correct queries and choosing appropriate visualizations. This means you can dive deep into sophisticated business intelligence without needing to know the intricacies of SQL or data visualization best practices.

## Best practices

To get the most out of the chat interface:

- Be specific about time periods when relevant
- Specify any filters or conditions clearly
- Ask follow-up questions to drill deeper into the data
- Use business metrics and terms familiar to your organization

## Limitations

While the chat interface is powerful, keep in mind:

- Complex statistical analyses might require traditional SQL queries
- Very long-running queries might be better suited for scheduled reports
- Some highly specialized visualizations might need manual configuration

## Saving and sharing

The chat interface makes it easy to preserve and distribute your insights. You can save interesting conversations for future reference, making it simple to revisit important analyses or build upon previous discoveries. Share insights with team members directly from the chat interface, export results to various formats for use in presentations or reports, and even convert chat-generated analyses into dashboard charts for ongoing monitoring. This flexibility ensures that valuable insights discovered through conversation can be preserved and integrated into your broader business intelligence workflow.
