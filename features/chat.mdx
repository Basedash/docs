Basedash's chat interface lets you have natural conversations with your data using AI. Instead of writing SQL queries or creating charts manually, you can ask questions in plain English and get instant insights. The chat supports generating charts and tables when needed.

## How it works

Navigate to the chat interface in your Basedash dashboard and type your question about your data in natural language. The AI will analyze your question, understand your data schema, and generate the appropriate SQL queries automatically.

Results are presented in a suitable format to communicate the answer to your question. You can also send chat messages from a chartâ€™s edit view to iterate on the query or formatting.

## Example questions

You can ask questions like:

- "Show me the trend of new user signups over the last 6 months"
- "What are our top 10 customers by revenue this year?"
- "Compare product sales across different regions"
- "Calculate the average order value by customer segment"
- "Find customers who haven't made a purchase in the last 30 days"

## Advanced analysis

The chat interface isn't limited to simple queries. You can perform complex analysis including cohort analysis, customer segmentation, retention metrics, funnel analysis, and anomaly detection. Describe what you want to analyze, and the AI will handle writing the queries and choosing appropriate visualizations.

## Best practices

To get the most out of the chat interface:

- Be specific about time periods when relevant
- Specify any filters or conditions clearly
- Ask follow-up questions to drill deeper into the data
- Use business metrics and terms familiar to your organization

## Limitations

While the chat interface is powerful, keep in mind:

- Complex statistical analyses might require traditional SQL queries
- Very long-running queries might be better suited for scheduled reports
- Some highly specialized visualizations might need manual configuration

## Saving and sharing

You can save conversations for future reference, share insights with team members, and convert chat-generated analyses into dashboard charts for ongoing monitoring.
