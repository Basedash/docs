Line charts are best for continuous trends over time. Use them when your x-axis is a date or timestamp.

## When to use

- Time series metrics (signups, revenue, conversions)
- Comparing trends with breakdowns (by region, plan, etc.)

## Example prompt

```
Show me daily user signups over the last 30 days as a line chart
```

## Tips

- Prefer `DAY`, `WEEK`, or `MONTH` intervals depending on range
- Use breakdowns to compare segments
