Line charts are the most common and effective way to visualize how metrics change over time. They're perfect for showing trends, patterns, and continuous data progression.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of line chart showing time series data with multiple metrics over time -->

## When to use line charts

### Perfect for:
- **Time series data**: Daily, weekly, monthly trends
- **Continuous metrics**: Revenue, user growth, performance metrics
- **Trend analysis**: Identifying patterns and seasonality
- **Multiple series comparison**: Comparing different metrics over time
- **Forecasting**: Visualizing projections and predictions

### Not ideal for:
- **Categorical comparisons**: Use [horizontal bar charts](/features/chart-types/horizontal-bar-charts) instead
- **Discrete data points**: Use [timebar charts](/features/chart-types/timebar-charts) for specific periods
- **Large datasets with many categories**: Can become cluttered

## Example queries

### Basic time series
```
Show me daily user signups over the last 30 days
```

### Multiple metrics comparison
```
Display monthly revenue and expenses as a line chart for the past year
```

### Trend analysis
```
Create a line chart showing weekly active users trend for the past 6 months
```

### Performance metrics
```
Show me page load times by day over the last 2 weeks
```

## Prompt examples

### Basic time series
```
Show me user signups over time as a line chart
```

### Multiple metrics
```

```

### Trend analysis
```
Create a line chart showing active users over time
```

### Performance metrics
```
Show me page load times over time as a line chart
```

## Best practices

### Data preparation
- **Consistent time intervals**: Use regular intervals (daily, weekly, monthly)
- **Handle missing data**: Use appropriate aggregation for gaps
- **Sort chronologically**: Always order by date ascending
- **Limit data points**: Avoid overcrowding (max 50-100 points for clarity)

### Visual design
- **Clear axis labels**: Include units and time periods
- **Appropriate scales**: Start from zero unless there's a good reason not to
- **Color coding**: Use distinct colors for multiple series
- **Grid lines**: Add subtle grid lines for easier reading

### Common use cases

#### Business metrics
- Revenue trends
- User growth
- Conversion rates
- Customer acquisition costs

#### Product analytics
- Feature usage over time
- User engagement metrics
- Performance indicators
- Error rates

#### Marketing campaigns
- Campaign performance
- Traffic sources
- Conversion funnels
- ROI tracking

## Advanced features

### Annotations
Add context to your line charts:
- Mark important events (launches, campaigns)
- Highlight anomalies or outliers
- Show goal lines or benchmarks

### Multiple series
Compare different metrics:
- Use consistent scales when possible
- Limit to 3-5 series for clarity
- Use different line styles (solid, dashed, dotted)

### Trend lines
Add trend analysis:
- Linear regression lines
- Moving averages
- Seasonal decomposition

## Common pitfalls

### Avoid these mistakes:
1. **Too many data points**: Creates visual noise
2. **Inconsistent intervals**: Makes trends hard to interpret
3. **Missing context**: No baseline or comparison
4. **Poor color choices**: Hard to distinguish series
5. **No data labels**: Difficult to read exact values

### Data quality issues:
- **Missing values**: Handle gaps appropriately
- **Outliers**: Consider whether to include or exclude
- **Seasonality**: Account for regular patterns
- **Scale changes**: Be careful with log scales

## Example scenarios

### E-commerce dashboard
```
Show me daily revenue, orders, and average order value for the past 3 months
```

### SaaS metrics
```
Display monthly recurring revenue, churn rate, and customer count over the last year
```

### Marketing performance
```
Create a line chart of weekly website traffic, conversions, and cost per acquisition
```
