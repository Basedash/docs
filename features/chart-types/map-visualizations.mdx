Map visualizations show geographic data grouped by country (global) or US state, with a list of groupings over time. They're perfect for understanding regional patterns like website visitors by state or sign-ups by country.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of map visualization showing geographic data with color-coded regions -->

## When to use map visualizations

### Perfect for:
- **Global data**: Website visitors by country, sign-ups by country
- **US state data**: Regional performance by US state
- **Geographic trends**: Regional patterns over time
- **Location-based metrics**: Where your users or customers are located
- **Regional analysis**: Performance by geographic regions

### Not ideal for:
- **Non-geographic data**: Use other chart types instead
- **City-level data**: Currently limited to country/state level
- **Custom regions**: Contact us for custom geographic groupings
- **Detailed location data**: Use [tables](/features/chart-types/tables) for precise coordinates

## Example queries

### Website visitors by country
```
Show me website visitors by country on a map
```

### Sign-ups by US state
```
Display user sign-ups by US state on a map
```

### Global user distribution
```
Create a map showing user distribution by country
```

### Regional performance
```
Show me sales performance by US state on a map
```



## Best practices

### Data preparation
- **Country/state data**: Ensure data includes country or US state fields
- **Consistent naming**: Use standardized country and state names
- **Handle missing data**: Account for null geographic values
- **Time-based grouping**: Include time periods for trend analysis

### Visual design
- **Global vs US maps**: Choose appropriate map type for your data
- **Color intensity**: Use colors to represent data values
- **Clear labels**: Include geographic names and values
- **Time series list**: Review the list of groupings over time

### Common use cases

#### Website analytics
- Website visitors by country
- Page views by US state
- Traffic sources by region
- Regional engagement metrics

#### User acquisition
- Sign-ups by country
- User registration by US state
- Regional conversion rates
- Geographic growth patterns

#### Business intelligence
- Revenue by US state
- Customer distribution by country
- Regional performance metrics
- Geographic market analysis

## Current limitations

### Geographic granularity
- **Global maps**: Country-level grouping only
- **US maps**: State-level grouping only
- **No city-level**: Currently not supported
- **No custom regions**: Standard geographic boundaries only

### Custom aggregations
- **Contact us**: For custom country groupings
- **County-level data**: Available upon request
- **Custom regions**: Special arrangements required
- **Advanced features**: Enterprise-level options

## Common pitfalls

### Avoid these mistakes:
1. **Wrong geographic level**: Use country for global, state for US
2. **Missing geographic data**: Ensure country/state fields are populated
3. **Inconsistent naming**: Use standardized country and state names
4. **No time context**: Include time periods for meaningful analysis
5. **Expecting city-level**: Currently limited to country/state

### Data quality issues:
- **Missing country/state data**: Handle null geographic values
- **Inconsistent naming**: Use standard geographic naming conventions
- **Time-based data**: Ensure proper time grouping for trends
- **Geographic accuracy**: Verify country and state data accuracy

## Example scenarios

### Website analytics
```
Show me website visitors by country for the past month
```
