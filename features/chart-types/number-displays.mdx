Number displays are perfect for highlighting key performance indicators (KPIs) and single metric values. They provide a clear, prominent way to showcase important numbers that matter most to your business.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of number display showing prominent KPI with context and formatting -->

## When to use number charts

### Perfect for:
- **Key metrics**: Revenue, user count, conversion rates
- **KPIs**: Important business indicators
- **Summary statistics**: Totals, averages, percentages
- **Goal tracking**: Progress toward targets
- **Dashboard highlights**: Most important metrics

### Not ideal for:
- **Trends over time**: Use [line charts](/features/chart-types/line-charts) instead
- **Comparisons**: Use [horizontal bar charts](/features/chart-types/horizontal-bar-charts) instead
- **Detailed data**: Use [tables](/features/chart-types/tables) instead
- **Multiple metrics**: Consider grouped displays

## Example queries

### Basic KPI display
```
Show me total revenue as a number
```

### Goal tracking
```
Display current month revenue vs target
```

### Summary metrics
```
Show me total active users as a number
```

### Performance indicators
```
Display customer satisfaction score as a number
```

## Prompt examples

### Basic metric display
```
Show me total revenue as a number
```

### Goal tracking
```
Display current revenue vs target as a number
```

### Growth calculation
```
Show me revenue growth percentage as a number
```

### Average metrics
```
Display average order value as a number
```

### Percentage calculations
```
Show me order completion rate as a number
```

## Best practices

### Data preparation
- **Clear calculations**: Ensure the metric is well-defined
- **Appropriate time periods**: Use relevant time windows
- **Handle nulls**: Account for missing data appropriately
- **Consistent formatting**: Use appropriate decimal places

### Visual design
- **Prominent display**: Make the number large and clear
- **Context labels**: Include units and time periods
- **Color coding**: Use colors to indicate performance (green/red)
- **Comparison context**: Show change from previous period

### Common use cases

#### Business metrics
- Total revenue
- Customer count
- Order volume
- Average order value

#### Performance indicators
- Conversion rates
- Customer satisfaction scores
- Response times
- Error rates

#### Growth metrics
- Month-over-month growth
- Year-over-year growth
- Customer acquisition rate
- Churn rate

## Advanced features

### Goal tracking
Show progress toward targets:
- Revenue vs target
- User growth vs goal
- Performance vs benchmarks
- Completion rates

### Trend indicators
Show direction of change:
- Up/down arrows
- Percentage change
- Color coding (green/red)
- Comparison periods

### Multiple metrics
Display related numbers:
- Current vs previous period
- Actual vs target
- Multiple KPIs together
- Breakdown by category

## Common pitfalls

### Avoid these mistakes:
1. **No context**: Missing units, time periods, or comparisons
2. **Poor formatting**: Too many decimal places or unclear units
3. **Missing trends**: No indication of performance direction
4. **Outdated data**: Not updating frequently enough
5. **Wrong calculations**: Incorrect metric definitions

### Data quality issues:
- **Stale data**: Ensure real-time or near-real-time updates
- **Calculation errors**: Verify metric formulas
- **Missing context**: Include baseline or comparison data
- **Inconsistent definitions**: Use standardized metric definitions
