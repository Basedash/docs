Timebar charts show bars over time intervals (e.g., per day or per month). Useful when counts per period should be emphasized.

## When to use

- Periodic totals (orders per day, tickets per week)
- Comparing grouped bars with breakdowns

## Example prompt

```
Show me orders per day for the last 90 days
```
