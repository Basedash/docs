Timebar charts are time-associated bar charts that show data progression over time. They're perfect for displaying time-based data in aggregate form, showing trends and patterns over discrete time periods like days, weeks, months, or quarters.

## When to use timebar charts

### Perfect for:
- **Time-based data**: Revenue over time, user signups by month
- **Aggregate trends**: Data grouped by time periods
- **Period comparisons**: Monthly, quarterly, or yearly data
- **Time progression**: Showing how metrics change over time
- **Seasonal patterns**: Identifying trends across time periods

### Not ideal for:
- **Non-time data**: Use [horizontal bar charts](/features/chart-types/horizontal-bar-charts) for categorical data
- **Continuous trends**: Use [line charts](/features/chart-types/line-charts) for smooth trend lines
- **Real-time data**: Better suited for [line charts](/features/chart-types/line-charts)
- **Very long time periods**: Can become cluttered

## Example queries

### Time-based trends
```
Show me revenue over time as a timebar chart
```

### Monthly data
```
Create a timebar chart of user signups by month
```

### Quarterly performance
```
Display quarterly sales performance as a timebar chart
```

### Weekly trends
```
Show me website traffic by week as a timebar chart
```



## Best practices

### Data preparation
- **Consistent intervals**: Use regular time periods (weekly, monthly, quarterly)
- **Handle missing periods**: Include zero values for missing time periods
- **Sort chronologically**: Always order by time ascending
- **Limit time range**: Keep to reasonable periods (12-24 months max)

### Visual design
- **Clear time labels**: Use consistent date formatting
- **Appropriate scales**: Start from zero for fair comparisons
- **Color coding**: Use colors to highlight trends or patterns
- **Grid lines**: Add subtle grid lines for easier reading

### Common use cases

#### Business metrics
- Monthly revenue trends
- Quarterly performance comparisons
- Annual growth analysis
- Seasonal pattern identification

#### Marketing analysis
- Campaign performance by period
- Traffic patterns by week/month
- Conversion rates over time
- ROI by campaign period

#### Operational metrics
- Support volume by month
- System performance by week
- Resource utilization by quarter
- Project completion rates

## Advanced features

### Multiple series
Compare different metrics over time:
- Revenue vs expenses by month
- Signups vs activations by week
- Performance vs targets by quarter

### Annotations
Add context to your timebar charts:
- Mark important events or milestones
- Highlight anomalies or outliers
- Show goal lines or benchmarks

### Trend analysis
Add trend indicators:
- Period-over-period growth
- Moving averages
- Seasonal adjustments

## Common pitfalls

### Avoid these mistakes:
1. **Too many time periods**: Creates visual clutter
2. **Inconsistent intervals**: Makes comparisons difficult
3. **Missing context**: No baseline or comparison
4. **Poor time formatting**: Confusing date labels
5. **No trend indicators**: Hard to see patterns

### Data quality issues:
- **Missing time periods**: Handle gaps appropriately
- **Seasonal variations**: Account for regular patterns
- **Outliers**: Consider whether to include or exclude
- **Data granularity**: Match time periods to data availability

## Example scenarios

### E-commerce dashboard
```
Show me monthly revenue, orders, and average order value for the past 12 months
```

### SaaS metrics
```
Display quarterly recurring revenue and customer count for the last 4 quarters
```

### Marketing performance
```
Create a timebar chart of weekly website traffic and conversions for the past 3 months
```

### Project management
```
Show me project completion rates by month for the current year
```
