Funnel charts show the progression through a series of steps in any journey, automatically calculating drop-offs between stages. They're perfect for analyzing activation rates, onboarding flows, MRR growth, or any multi-step process where you want to see progression and drop-offs. **Important**: You must explicitly define the steps of your journey for the funnel to work properly.

## When to use funnel charts

### Perfect for:
- **Predefined time periods**: MRR growth month over month
- **Explicit journey steps**: User onboarding with defined stages
- **Clear process stages**: Sales pipeline with specific milestones
- **Drop-off analysis**: Identify where users/items leave the journey
- **Process optimization**: Find bottlenecks in any workflow

### Not ideal for:
- **Vague journey descriptions**: "User activation funnel" without defined steps
- **Time series data**: Use [line charts](/features/chart-types/line-charts) instead
- **Category comparisons**: Use [horizontal bar charts](/features/chart-types/horizontal-bar-charts) instead
- **Proportions of a whole**: Use [pie charts](/features/chart-types/pie-charts) instead
- **Single metrics**: Use [number displays](/features/chart-types/number-displays) instead

## Example queries

### Predefined time periods
```
Show me MRR growth month over month as a funnel chart
```

### Onboarding with defined steps
```
Display onboarding drop-offs: signup, email verification, profile completion, first action
```

### User journey with explicit steps
```
Show me user activation journey: visit, signup, email verification, first login, first feature use
```

### Sales pipeline with clear stages
```
Create a funnel chart of sales pipeline: lead created, qualified, proposal sent, negotiation, closed won
```

### Marketing funnel with defined steps
```
Show me marketing funnel: website visit, page view, form fill, email signup, conversion
```



## Best practices

### Journey definition
- **Explicit step definition**: You must clearly define each step of the journey
- **Describe each step**: Clearly define what each stage represents
- **Natural progression**: Ensure stages follow a logical order
- **Consistent time periods**: Use the same time window for all stages
- **Clear stage names**: Use descriptive, consistent naming

### Automatic ordering
- **Basedash ordering**: AI automatically orders stages logically
- **Drop-off calculation**: Automatic calculation of drop-offs between stages
- **Proportional display**: Bars sized proportionally to stage values
- **Clear progression**: Visual flow from top to bottom

### Common use cases

#### User journeys
- Signup to activation flows
- Onboarding completion rates
- Feature adoption funnels
- User engagement progression

#### Business metrics
- MRR growth month over month
- Revenue progression by stage
- Customer lifetime value growth
- Subscription upgrade flows

#### Process optimization
- Sales pipeline analysis
- Support ticket resolution
- Manufacturing processes
- Quality control workflows

## Advanced features

### Multi-source data
Pull from different data sources:
- Different tables for each stage
- Various event types and sources
- Mixed data types and formats
- Cross-system journey tracking

### Drop-off analysis
Identify specific drop-off points:
- Stage-by-stage conversion rates
- Bottleneck identification
- Optimization opportunities
- Performance benchmarking

### Journey optimization
Improve process efficiency:
- Identify problematic stages
- Compare different time periods
- Test process improvements
- Track optimization results

## Common pitfalls

### Avoid these mistakes:
1. **Inconsistent definitions**: Ensure stage definitions are clear
2. **Wrong time windows**: Use appropriate time periods for each stage
3. **Missing context**: Include baseline or comparison data
4. **Too many stages**: Keep to 5-7 stages for clarity
5. **No drop-off analysis**: Focus on where users leave

### Data quality issues:
- **Attribution problems**: Ensure proper user/session tracking
- **Duplicate counting**: Handle multiple events per user
- **Missing stages**: Account for users who skip stages
- **Sample size**: Ensure sufficient data for each stage

## Example scenarios

### E-commerce optimization
```
Show me the conversion funnel from homepage visit to purchase completion
```

### SaaS onboarding
```
Create a funnel chart of user signup to feature activation
```

### Marketing campaign
```
Display lead generation funnel from ad click to qualified lead
```

### Customer support
```
Show me support ticket resolution funnel by priority level
```
