Activity charts display GitHub-style heatmaps that show daily activity patterns over time. They're perfect for visualizing daily summaries of events, user activity, or any metric that occurs on a daily basis.

## When to use activity charts

### Perfect for:
- **Daily activity patterns**: User signups, logins, or events per day
- **GitHub-style heatmaps**: Visual representation of daily activity intensity
- **Habit tracking**: Daily occurrences of specific events
- **Activity streaks**: Identifying periods of consistent activity
- **Daily summaries**: Aggregated daily metrics

### Not ideal for:
- **Hourly patterns**: Use other chart types for sub-daily granularity
- **Category comparisons**: Use [horizontal bar charts](/features/chart-types/horizontal-bar-charts) instead
- **Single metrics**: Use [number displays](/features/chart-types/number-displays) instead
- **Detailed data**: Use [tables](/features/chart-types/tables) instead

## Example queries

### User signups
```
Show me user signups over time in an activity chart
```

### Daily activity
```
Display daily user logins as an activity chart
```

### Event tracking
```
Create an activity chart of daily order completions
```

### Habit tracking
```
Show me daily exercise sessions in an activity chart
```



## Best practices

### Data preparation
- **Daily aggregation**: Always group by DATE() for daily summaries
- **Handle missing days**: Include zero values for days with no activity
- **Consistent time periods**: Use consistent date ranges (typically 90 days to 1 year)
- **Single metric focus**: Focus on one type of activity per chart

### Visual design
- **Color intensity**: Darker colors indicate higher activity levels
- **Clear date labels**: Include month/year labels for context
- **Legend**: Provide clear legend for activity intensity scale
- **Grid layout**: Days of week on x-axis, weeks on y-axis

### Common use cases

#### User activity tracking
- Daily user signups
- Daily login activity
- Daily feature usage
- Daily engagement metrics

#### Habit and behavior tracking
- Daily exercise sessions
- Daily study sessions
- Daily task completions
- Daily goal achievements

#### Business metrics
- Daily order completions
- Daily customer interactions
- Daily content creation
- Daily system events

## Advanced features

### Activity streaks
Identify consistent patterns:
- Consecutive days of activity
- Longest activity streaks
- Break patterns in activity
- Consistency metrics

### Seasonal patterns
Identify recurring patterns:
- Weekly patterns (weekend vs weekday)
- Monthly patterns
- Seasonal variations
- Holiday impacts

### Intensity analysis
Understand activity levels:
- High activity periods
- Low activity periods
- Activity distribution
- Peak activity identification

## Common pitfalls

### Avoid these mistakes:
1. **Sub-daily granularity**: Activity charts only work with daily data
2. **Multiple metrics**: Focus on one activity type per chart
3. **Missing days**: Include zero values for days with no activity
4. **Poor date ranges**: Use appropriate time periods (90 days to 1 year)
5. **Complex aggregations**: Keep aggregations simple and daily-focused

### Data quality issues:
- **Non-daily data**: Ensure data is aggregated to daily level
- **Missing dates**: Fill in missing dates with zero values
- **Inconsistent activity definition**: Clearly define what counts as activity
- **Too short time periods**: Use sufficient history for meaningful patterns

## Example scenarios

### User signups
```
Show me user signups over time in an activity chart for the past year
```

### Daily logins
```
Display daily user login activity as an activity chart
```

### Order completions
```
Create an activity chart of daily order completions for the last 6 months
```

### Feature usage
```
Show me daily feature usage activity in an activity chart
```

### Exercise tracking
```
Display daily exercise sessions as an activity chart
```

## Interpreting activity charts

### Pattern identification
- **Activity streaks**: Identify consecutive days of activity
- **Gaps**: Find periods with no activity
- **Weekly patterns**: Understand weekend vs weekday patterns
- **Seasonal trends**: Spot long-term activity patterns

### Business insights
- **User engagement**: Understand daily user activity patterns
- **Growth trends**: Identify periods of increased activity
- **Habit formation**: Track consistent daily behaviors
- **Seasonal impacts**: Understand how seasons affect activity
