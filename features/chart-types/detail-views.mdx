Detail charts show details of a single record with all its metadata and columns. They're perfect for creating entity-level pages that display comprehensive information about individual items like users, orders, or products, including calculated columns and external service links.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of detail view showing single record with metadata, calculated columns, and external links -->

## When to use detail views

### Perfect for:
- **Single record display**: Show all columns and metadata for one item
- **Entity profiles**: User profiles, order details, product information
- **Calculated columns**: Add computed fields from related tables
- **External links**: Create URLs to connected services (Stripe, HubSpot, etc.)
- **Entity-level pages**: Comprehensive view of individual items

### Not ideal for:
- **Multiple records**: Use [tables](/features/chart-types/tables) instead
- **Trends over time**: Use [line charts](/features/chart-types/line-charts) instead
- **Comparisons**: Use [horizontal bar charts](/features/chart-types/horizontal-bar-charts) instead
- **Summary metrics**: Use [number displays](/features/chart-types/number-displays) instead

## Example queries

### User profile
```
Show me user details for user ID 12345
```

### Order details
```
Display order details for order #ABC123
```

### Product details
```
Show me product details for product ID XYZ789
```

### Customer profile
```
Create a detail view for customer john.doe@example.com
```

## Content types

### Entity metadata
All columns and fields for the record:
- Basic information (name, email, ID, etc.)
- Timestamps (created_at, updated_at)
- Status fields (active, verified, etc.)
- Categorical data (plan, region, etc.)

### Calculated columns
Computed fields from related data:
- Activity counts from other tables
- Average values (order value, session duration)
- Aggregated metrics (total spent, order count)
- Derived fields (age, days since last activity)

### External links
URLs to connected services:
- Stripe customer links
- HubSpot contact links
- Zendesk ticket links
- Custom service URLs

### Related data
Information from connected tables:
- Recent activity
- Associated records
- Historical data
- Related metrics



## Best practices

### Single record focus
- **One record per view**: Always filter to a specific record ID
- **All columns included**: Show all metadata and fields for the entity
- **Clear identification**: Use descriptive titles with the entity name/ID
- **Consistent structure**: Maintain consistent layout across entity types

### Calculated columns
- **Meaningful aggregations**: Add useful computed fields from related tables
- **Performance metrics**: Include activity counts, averages, and totals
- **Derived fields**: Calculate age, time differences, and ratios
- **External data**: Pull in relevant information from connected services

### External links
- **Service integration**: Create URLs to Stripe, HubSpot, Zendesk, etc.
- **Example URLs**: Provide examples to help AI generate correct links
- **Consistent formatting**: Use standard URL patterns for each service
- **Clickable links**: Ensure URLs are properly formatted for clicking
