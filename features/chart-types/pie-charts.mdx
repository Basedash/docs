Pie charts are excellent for showing how a whole is divided into parts. They're most effective when you want to emphasize proportions and percentages rather than absolute values.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of pie chart showing proportions with clear segments and percentage labels -->

## When to use pie charts

### Perfect for:
- **Proportions of a whole**: Market share, budget allocation
- **Simple comparisons**: 2-7 categories maximum
- **Percentage data**: Survey results, demographic breakdowns
- **Quick visual impact**: Easy to understand at a glance
- **Small datasets**: 3-10 categories work best

### Not ideal for:
- **Many categories**: Becomes cluttered with >7 segments
- **Similar values**: Hard to compare when segments are close in size
- **Time series data**: Use [line charts](/features/chart-types/line-charts) instead
- **Ranking data**: Use [horizontal bar charts](/features/chart-types/horizontal-bar-charts) instead
- **Precise comparisons**: [Horizontal bar charts](/features/chart-types/horizontal-bar-charts) are better for exact values

## Example queries

### Basic proportions
```
Show me sales distribution by product category as a pie chart
```

### Survey results
```
Create a pie chart of customer satisfaction ratings
```

### Budget allocation
```
Display monthly expenses breakdown by department
```

### Market share
```
Show me market share by competitor
```



## Best practices

### Data preparation
- **Limit categories**: Keep to 5-7 segments maximum
- **Group small values**: Combine categories <5% into "Other"
- **Sort logically**: Order by size (largest to smallest) or alphabetically
- **Handle nulls**: Include or exclude null categories appropriately

### Visual design
- **Start at 12 o'clock**: Begin the largest segment at the top
- **Use contrasting colors**: Ensure segments are easily distinguishable
- **Include percentages**: Show percentage labels for clarity
- **Add a legend**: Include category names and values

### Common use cases

#### Business analytics
- Revenue by product line
- Customer distribution by segment
- Market share analysis
- Budget allocation

#### Marketing analysis
- Traffic sources
- Lead sources
- Campaign performance
- Customer acquisition channels

#### Survey and feedback
- Customer satisfaction scores
- Feature preference data
- Demographics breakdown
- Response rates by channel

## Advanced features

### Donut charts
Similar to pie charts but with center space:
- Can include additional information in the center
- Often used for KPIs or summary metrics
- Slightly more modern appearance

### Exploded pie charts
Highlight specific segments:
- Pull out important segments
- Draw attention to key data points
- Use sparingly for maximum impact

### 3D pie charts
Add depth for visual appeal:
- Can make segments easier to distinguish
- Use carefully to avoid distortion
- Consider accessibility implications

## Common pitfalls

### Avoid these mistakes:
1. **Too many segments**: Creates visual clutter and confusion
2. **Similar segment sizes**: Hard to compare when values are close
3. **Missing context**: No total value or comparison baseline
4. **Poor color choices**: Hard to distinguish between segments
5. **No labels**: Difficult to identify categories and values

### Data quality issues:
- **Small sample sizes**: May not be statistically significant
- **Missing data**: Consider how to handle null or unknown values
- **Inconsistent categories**: Ensure categories are mutually exclusive
- **Temporal changes**: Pie charts don't show trends over time

## Example scenarios

### E-commerce analysis
```
Show me order distribution by payment method for the current month
```

### Customer service metrics
```
Create a pie chart of support ticket categories
```

### Financial reporting
```
Display revenue breakdown by business unit
```

### Product analytics
```
Show me user activity distribution by feature
```

## When to choose alternatives

### Use bar charts instead when:
- You have more than 7 categories
- You need to show exact values
- You want to compare across categories
- You need to show trends over time

### Use tables instead when:
- You need precise numerical values
- You have many categories
- You want to show additional metadata
- You need to sort or filter the data
