Text components display raw text content from single records, formatted as JSON, Markdown, or SQL. They're perfect for showing large amounts of text data from entity dashboards, with automatic formatting based on the content type.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of text component showing formatted JSON/Markdown/SQL content with syntax highlighting -->

## When to use text components

### Perfect for:
- **Raw text data**: JSON, Markdown, or SQL content from records
- **Entity information**: Large text fields from single records
- **Formatted content**: Automatically formatted text display
- **Documentation**: Technical documentation or notes
- **Code snippets**: SQL queries, JSON responses, or Markdown content

### Not ideal for:
- **Data visualization**: Use charts instead
- **Numerical data**: Use [number displays](/features/chart-types/number-displays) instead
- **Multiple records**: Use [tables](/features/chart-types/tables) instead
- **Interactive content**: Use other components instead

## Example queries

### JSON content
```
Show me the user profile data as text
```

### Markdown content
```
Display the product description as text
```

### SQL content
```
Show me the query results as text
```

### Raw text data
```
Display the error log content as text
```

## Content types

### JSON data
Structured data in JSON format:
- API responses
- Configuration data
- User profile information
- System settings

### Markdown content
Formatted text in Markdown:
- Product descriptions
- Documentation
- Notes and comments
- Rich text content

### SQL content
Database query results:
- Query outputs
- Raw data dumps
- Database logs
- SQL script results

### Raw text
Plain text content:
- Error logs
- System messages
- Plain text fields
- Unformatted content

## Best practices

### Content formatting
- **Automatic detection**: Basedash automatically detects JSON, Markdown, or SQL
- **Proper formatting**: Content is displayed in the appropriate dialect
- **Readable layout**: Text is formatted for easy reading
- **Syntax highlighting**: Code and structured data are properly highlighted

### Data selection
- **Single record focus**: Display text from one specific record
- **Large text fields**: Perfect for showing substantial text content
- **Entity context**: Often used with detail views for comprehensive information
- **Raw data display**: Show unprocessed text content as-is
