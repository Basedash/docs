Basedash makes it easy to create beautiful, interactive charts using natural language. Our AI understands your data and helps you choose the right visualization automatically.

## Creating charts

### Using natural language

1. Click "Add chart" on a dashboard or create a standalone chart
2. Describe what you want to see, for example:
   - "Show me daily user signups over the last 30 days"
   - "Display revenue by product category as a pie chart"
   - "Create a bar chart of top 10 customers by order value"
3. Basedash AI will:
   - Write the appropriate SQL query
   - Choose the best visualization type
   - Apply suitable formatting and styling

## How AI chooses chart types

- **Data type analysis**: Detects dates, numbers, and categories
- **Query intent**: Understands trends, comparisons, proportions, and conversions
- **Data volume**: Considers number of points and categories
- **Best practices**: Applies visualization best practices automatically
- **SQL generation**: Creates the SQL needed to fetch your data

## Chart types

### Data visualization charts

- [Line charts](/features/chart-types/line-charts) – Trends and patterns over time
- [Timebar charts](/features/chart-types/timebar-charts) – Time-based bar visualizations
- [Horizontal bar charts](/features/chart-types/horizontal-bar-charts) – Non-time categorical comparisons
- [Pie charts](/features/chart-types/pie-charts) – Proportions and parts of a whole
- [Funnel charts](/features/chart-types/funnel-charts) – Conversion analysis and flow

### Data display components

- [Tables](/features/chart-types/tables) – Detailed tabular data display
- [Number displays](/features/chart-types/number-displays) – Single metric values
- [Text components](/features/chart-types/text-components) – Text and narrative content
- [Detail charts](/features/chart-types/detail-views) – Detailed information panels

### Specialized visualizations

- [Activity charts](/features/chart-types/activity-charts) – Activity patterns and heatmaps
- [Map visualizations](/features/chart-types/map-visualizations) – Geographic data display
- [Image charts](/features/chart-types/image) – Image content presentation

## Requesting specific chart types

- "Show me monthly revenue as a line chart"
- "Create a pie chart of sales by region"
- "Display customer satisfaction scores as a horizontal bar chart"
- "Show conversion rates in a funnel chart"
- "Display total revenue as a number"
- "Show me user activity patterns as an activity chart"

## Adding breakdowns

Use the "broken down by" syntax to create multiple series:

- "Show me user signups broken down by email domain"
- "Display sales broken down by product category"
- "Create a chart of visitors broken down by page"
- "Show me revenue over time broken down by region"

See [breakdowns](/features/chart-types/breakdowns) for examples and best practices.

## Customizing charts

### Visual customization

- Adjust axis labels and ranges
- Change colors and themes
- Modify chart titles and descriptions
- Configure legends and formatting (currency, percentages, etc.)

### Data customization

- Edit the underlying SQL query
- Change aggregation methods
- Add calculated fields
- Filter data points
- Sort and limit results

### Advanced SQL editing

AI handles most query needs, but you can always edit the SQL powering any chart for full control. For complex queries, use the [SQL editor](/features/sql-editor).

## Best practices

### Choose based on your goal

- **Trends over time**: Line charts, timebar charts
- **Comparisons**: Horizontal bar charts
- **Proportions**: Pie charts
- **Conversions**: Funnel charts
- **Single metrics**: Number displays
- **Activity patterns**: Activity charts
- **Geographic data**: Map visualizations

### Consider your data

- **Small datasets** (< 10 categories): Pie charts work well
- **Large datasets** (> 20 categories): Horizontal bar charts are better
- **Time series**: Use line charts for continuous trends
- **Categorical data**: Use horizontal bar charts

### Design for clarity

- Keep charts simple and focused
- Use clear, descriptive titles
- Add context with descriptions
- Choose appropriate time ranges
