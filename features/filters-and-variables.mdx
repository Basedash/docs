Filters allow you to create dynamic, interactive dashboards that adapt to user selections and time ranges. They work at the dashboard level and automatically inject values into your chart queries, making it easy to explore different data slices without rewriting prompts.

## How filters work

Filters are dashboard-level controls that automatically add variables to your chart queries. When you reference entities or time periods in your prompts, Basedash intelligently creates the appropriate filters and injects them into your SQL queries.

### Automatic filter creation

Basedash automatically creates filters when you use certain language patterns in your prompts:

- **Entity references**: "Show me details for a user" → Creates a user selector
- **Time references**: "Revenue over time" → Creates date range filters
- **Aggregation references**: "Group by category" → Creates grouping options

## Filter types

Basedash supports six different filter types that you can use to create dynamic, interactive dashboards. Each type serves a specific purpose and provides different functionality.

### Record filters

Record filters allow you to select specific records from your database tables. They're perfect for entity-level dashboards where you want to focus on individual records.

**Features:**
- Dropdown selection from database records
- Automatic population from your data source
- Support for multiple values (optional)
- Required/optional configuration

**Common use cases:**
- User profile dashboards
- Order detail pages
- Customer account views
- Product detail pages

**Example:**
```
Show me user details for a specific user
```

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of record filter dropdown showing user selection with multiple users listed -->
<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of text filter input field with search functionality -->
<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of number filter with min/max range controls -->
<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of boolean filter with toggle/checkbox interface -->
<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of list filter dropdown with predefined options -->
<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of SQL filter with custom query input field -->

### Text filters

Text filters provide free-form text input for string-based filtering and search functionality.

**Features:**
- Free text input
- String matching and search
- Case-sensitive and case-insensitive options
- Support for partial matches

**Common use cases:**
- Name searches
- Email filtering

Show me orders with total value greater than $100
```

### Boolean filters

Boolean filters provide true/false or yes/no selection options for binary filtering.

**Features:**
- Toggle or checkbox interface
- True/false selection
- Default value configuration
- Simple binary logic

**Common use cases:**
- Active/inactive status
- Feature flags
- Subscription status
- Binary classifications

**Example:**
```
Show me only active users
```

### List filters

List filters provide predefined selection options from a curated list of values.

**Features:**
- Dropdown with predefined options
- Single or multiple selection
- Custom option lists
- Static value management

**Common use cases:**
- Category selection
- Region filtering
- Status selection
- Department filtering

**Example:**
```
Show me sales by region (North, South, East, West)
```

### SQL filters

SQL filters allow you to create custom SQL-based filtering logic for complex queries.

**Features:**
- Custom SQL query input
- Advanced filtering logic
- Dynamic query generation
- Complex conditional logic

**Common use cases:**
- Custom business logic
- Complex filtering requirements
- Dynamic query conditions
- Advanced data manipulation

**Example:**
```
Show me users who meet custom criteria defined in SQL
```

## Built-in filters

Basedash provides three built-in filters that are automatically available on all dashboards:

### Start date
A date picker that allows users to select the beginning of a time range for analysis.

### End date
A date picker that allows users to select the end of a time range for analysis.

### Time interval
A dropdown that provides preset time intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) for consistent time-based analysis.

These built-in filters are automatically created when you reference time-based analysis in your prompts and can be used across multiple charts on the same dashboard.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of built-in filters showing start date, end date, and time interval controls on a dashboard -->

## Filter configuration options

### Multiple values
Enable "Allow multiple values" to let users select multiple options from list and record filters.

### Required filters
Mark filters as "Required" to ensure they always have a value before queries execute.

### Public dashboard visibility
Control whether filters appear on public dashboards with the "Show on public dashboard" option.

### Default values
Set default values for filters to provide starting points for user interactions.

## Automatic filter creation

Basedash automatically creates appropriate filter types when you use certain language patterns in your prompts:

- **Entity references**: "Show me details for a user" → Creates a record filter
- **Time references**: "Revenue over time" → Creates date range filters
- **Text searches**: "Customers named John" → Creates text filters
- **Numeric thresholds**: "Orders over $100" → Creates number filters
- **Boolean conditions**: "Only active users" → Creates boolean filters
- **Category selections**: "Sales by region" → Creates list filters

## Using filters with chart types

### Line charts
```
Show me user signups over time
```
- **Time filters**: Automatically adds date range selection
- **Record filters**: Can add user selection for specific user trends
- **Number filters**: Can filter by thresholds (e.g., users with >10 logins)

### Bar charts
```
Show me companies by user size
```
- **Record filters**: Can add company selection for detailed views
- **List filters**: Can filter by industry, region, or other categories
- **Boolean filters**: Can show only active/inactive companies

### Funnel charts
```
Show me user activation funnel
```

## Best practices

### Use open-ended language
Instead of specific time periods, use open-ended language to leverage filters:

**Good:**
```
Show me user signups over time
```

**Avoid:**
```
Show me user signups for the last 7 days
```

### Reference other charts
Since Basedash AI understands your entire dashboard, you can reference other charts:

```
Show me the same data as the revenue chart but for a different time period
```

### Leverage entity context
For entity-level dashboards, use entity-specific language:

```
Show me this user's order history
Show me this organization's performance metrics
```

## Accessing and managing filters

### Variables tab in code editor
You can view and manage all filters for a dashboard by going to the **Variables** tab within the full-screen code editor. This shows all filters with their current values and allows you to modify filter configurations.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of Variables tab in code editor showing all filters with their values -->

### Filter highlighting
When you hover over a filter on a dashboard, charts that use that filter will be highlighted, making it easy to see which charts are affected by each filter.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot showing filter highlighting when hovering over a filter with affected charts highlighted -->

### Applying filters to other charts
To apply an existing filter to another chart, simply tell the AI to update the chart to use the filter. For example:

```
Update this chart to use the same date range as the revenue chart
```

```
Apply the user filter from the activity chart to this chart
```

The AI will automatically understand which filters are applicable and update the chart accordingly.

## Advanced features

### Cross-chart filtering
Filters can affect multiple charts on the same dashboard, creating cohesive analysis experiences.

### Dynamic variables
Filters can be used in calculated columns and external links:

```
Create a Stripe link for this user's customer ID
```

### Filter dependencies
Filters can be linked together, where one filter's selection affects the options available in another.
