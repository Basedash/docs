Insights is a feed of AI-generated posts that highlight what’s changed in your data and why it matters. Instead of checking dashboards to spot trends and anomalies, you can open Insights to see the most meaningful takeaways.

## How it works

Basedash automatically analyzes your connected data sources and generates insight posts. Each insight includes:

- A short explanation of what happened
- Supporting numbers and context
- A chart you can explore

## Where to find it

In Basedash, open the **Insights** page from the sidebar. New insights will show up there as they’re generated.

## Getting notified

You can enable email or Slack notifications for insights in the **Insights** page header.

If you want to create custom scheduled insights, use [Alerts](/features/alerts). Alerts run on a schedule and send AI-generated updates to your team.
