Basedash lets you create beautiful charts and dashboards using natural language. Just describe what you want to see and Basedash will generate the rest.

## What makes Basedash different?

Unlike traditional BI tools, Basedash uses AI to do the heavy lifting. Instead of manually writing SQL queries or clicking through complex chart builders, you can simply:

- **Describe your [charts](/features/charts) in plain English** - "Show me monthly revenue growth" or "Compare sales by region"
- **[Chat with your data](/features/chat)** - Ask follow-up questions and drill deeper into your insights
- **Get instant visualizations** - AI automatically chooses the best [chart type](/features/chart-types/introduction) and formatting
- **Collaborate with your team** - Share [dashboards](/features/dashboards) and insights across your organization
