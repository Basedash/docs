## Next steps: Add custom context

After connecting your data, we recommend setting up custom context to help the AI better understand your organization and data. This improves the accuracy of charts, reports, and chat responses.

### Quick setup
1. Press **Command + K** and type "custom context"
2. Add organization-wide context about your business, terminology, and key metrics
3. For complex data structures, add descriptions to schemas and columns in the data sources section

For detailed guidance on custom context, see our [custom context documentation](/features/custom-context).
