Basedash is built for teams. Invite your colleagues to collaborate on dashboards, share insights, and make data-driven decisions together.

## Inviting team members

To invite a team member, click on "Settings" in the navigation, then select "Team Members." Next, click "Invite Member," enter their email address, choose their role, and send the invitation.

## User roles

You can either be an Admin or a Member in an organization. **Admins** have the following priviliges:

- Manage data sources
- Organize members into groups for dashboard-level permissions
- Manage organization-level settings
- Manage billing

## Groups

You can create and add members to groups to control dashboard access. Once you've added members to groups, you will be able to go to a dashboard's settings and specify which groups should have access to a dashboard. Admins can manage groups from the command menu. See [sharing and collaboration](/features/dashboards#sharing-and-collaboration) for more details.
