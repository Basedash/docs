Basedash's chat interface allows you to have natural conversations with your data using AI. Instead of writing complex SQL queries or creating charts manually, you can simply ask questions in plain English and get instant insights.

## How it works

1. Navigate to the chat interface in your Basedash dashboard
2. Type your question about your data in natural language
3. AI will analyze your question, understand your data schema, and generate the appropriate SQL queries
4. Results are presented in the most suitable format (tables, charts, or narrative insights)

## Example questions

You can ask questions like:

- "Show me the trend of new user signups over the last 6 months"
- "What are our top 10 customers by revenue this year?"
- "Compare product sales across different regions"
- "Calculate the average order value by customer segment"
- "Find customers who haven't made a purchase in the last 30 days"

## Advanced analysis

The chat interface isn't limited to simple queries. You can perform complex analysis like:

- Cohort analysis
- Customer segmentation
- Retention metrics
- Funnel analysis
- Anomaly detection

Simply describe what you want to analyze, and AI will handle the complexity of writing the correct queries and choosing appropriate visualizations.

## Best practices

To get the most out of the chat interface:

- Be specific about time periods when relevant
- Specify any filters or conditions clearly
- Ask follow-up questions to drill deeper into the data
- Use business metrics and terms familiar to your organization

## Limitations

While the chat interface is powerful, keep in mind:

- Complex statistical analyses might require traditional SQL queries
- Very long-running queries might be better suited for scheduled reports
- Some highly specialized visualizations might need manual configuration

## Saving and sharing

You can:

- Save interesting conversations for future reference
- Share insights with team members
- Export results to various formats
- Convert chat-generated analyses into dashboard charts
