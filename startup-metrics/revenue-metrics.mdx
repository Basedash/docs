Revenue metrics are the heartbeat of your B2B SaaS startup. Once you've achieved product-market fit, Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) becomes your primary KPI that drives all other business decisions.

## Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)

**MRR** is the predictable revenue your business generates each month from subscriptions.

### How to calculate

**MRR** = Sum of all monthly subscription fees

For annual plans: **Annual contract value ÷ 12**

### MRR components

Break down your MRR to understand growth drivers:

- **New MRR**: Revenue from new customers this month
- **Expansion MRR**: Additional revenue from existing customers (upgrades, add-ons)
- **Churned MRR**: Revenue lost from customers who cancelled
- **Contraction MRR**: Revenue lost from downgrades

**Net New MRR** = New MRR + Expansion MRR - Churned MRR - Contraction MRR

### Why MRR matters

- Predictable, recurring revenue stream
- Easy to track month-over-month growth
- Helps with cash flow planning and forecasting
- Key metric for fundraising and valuation

### MRR growth benchmarks

- **Early stage** (pre-$1M ARR): 15-20% month-over-month
- **Growth stage** ($1M-$10M ARR): 8-15% month-over-month
- **Scale stage** ($10M+ ARR): 5-10% month-over-month

---

## Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)

**ARR** is your MRR multiplied by 12, representing your annualized subscription revenue.

### How to calculate

**ARR** = MRR × 12

### When to focus on ARR

- When you have mostly annual contracts
- For board reporting and fundraising
- When comparing to other SaaS companies
- For long-term planning and forecasting

### ARR vs actual revenue

ARR is a forward-looking metric, not realized revenue. It assumes current MRR continues for 12 months, which may not happen due to churn or growth.

---

## Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)

**ARPU** measures how much revenue you generate per customer on average.

### How to calculate

**ARPU** = Total MRR ÷ Number of paying customers

### ARPU variations

- **ARPU by customer segment**: Enterprise vs SMB customers
- **ARPU by cohort**: How ARPU changes over time for different customer groups
- **ARPU by acquisition channel**: Which channels bring higher-value customers

### Why ARPU matters

- Indicates pricing effectiveness
- Shows customer value realization
- Helps with market positioning
- Guides product and feature development

### Improving ARPU

- **Pricing optimization**: Test different price points and plans
- **Feature packaging**: Bundle features to encourage upgrades
- **Usage-based pricing**: Charge more as customers get more value
- **Cross-selling**: Sell additional products or services

---

## Revenue growth rate

Track how fast your revenue is growing over time.

### Month-over-month growth

**MoM growth rate** = (This month's MRR - Last month's MRR) ÷ Last month's MRR × 100

### Year-over-year growth

**YoY growth rate** = (This month's MRR - Same month last year's MRR) ÷ Same month last year's MRR × 100

### Compound monthly growth rate (CMGR)

For longer-term trends: **CMGR** = (Ending MRR ÷ Beginning MRR)^(1/number of months) - 1

### Growth sustainability

High growth rates are great, but focus on:
- **Sustainable growth**: Can you maintain this rate?
- **Profitable growth**: Are you growing efficiently?
- **Quality growth**: Are new customers staying and expanding?

---

## Revenue concentration and diversification

Understand how concentrated your revenue is across customers and segments.

### Customer concentration

**Top 10 customer concentration** = Revenue from top 10 customers ÷ Total revenue × 100

**Risk level**:
- Under 20%: Low risk, diversified
- 20-40%: Moderate risk
- Over 40%: High concentration risk

### Revenue diversification

Track revenue across:
- **Customer sizes**: Enterprise, mid-market, SMB
- **Industries**: Technology, healthcare, finance, etc.
- **Geographies**: North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific
- **Product lines**: Core product, add-ons, services

### Managing concentration risk

- **Expand customer base**: Acquire more customers in under-represented segments
- **Diversify offerings**: Create products for different customer types
- **Geographic expansion**: Enter new markets
- **Multiple pricing tiers**: Serve different customer segments

---

## Expansion revenue

Revenue growth from existing customers is often more valuable than new customer revenue.

### Net Revenue Retention (NRR)

**NRR** = (Starting MRR + Expansion MRR - Churned MRR - Contraction MRR) ÷ Starting MRR × 100

**Benchmarks**:
- 100%+: Good (no net revenue loss from existing customers)
- 110%+: Great
- 120%+: Exceptional

### Gross Revenue Retention (GRR)

**GRR** = (Starting MRR - Churned MRR - Contraction MRR) ÷ Starting MRR × 100

GRR shows how well you retain revenue without expansion.

### Expansion mechanisms

- **Seat expansion**: More users within the same account
- **Feature upgrades**: Moving to higher-tier plans
- **Usage growth**: Increased consumption in usage-based models
- **Cross-selling**: Additional products or modules

---

## Revenue forecasting

Predict future revenue to plan for growth and investment.

### Bottom-up forecasting

Build forecasts from:
- Current MRR base
- Expected churn rates
- New customer acquisition projections
- Expansion revenue estimates

### Top-down forecasting

Start with market size and work down:
- Total addressable market (TAM)
- Serviceable addressable market (SAM)
- Your expected market share

### Scenario planning

Create multiple forecasts:
- **Optimistic**: Everything goes better than expected
- **Realistic**: Based on current trends
- **Pessimistic**: Conservative assumptions

### Forecast accuracy

Track how accurate your forecasts are and improve over time:
- Monthly vs actual results
- Identify consistent biases
- Adjust models based on learnings

---

## Revenue operations and tracking

Set up systems to accurately track and report revenue metrics.

### Revenue recognition

Follow proper accounting principles:
- **Accrual accounting**: Record revenue when earned, not when paid
- **Subscription revenue**: Recognize ratably over the subscription period
- **Setup fees**: May need to be recognized over the customer lifetime

### Data sources

Connect revenue data from:
- Billing and subscription management systems
- CRM systems
- Payment processors
- Financial systems

### Automated reporting

Create dashboards that automatically calculate and display:
- Current MRR and ARR
- MRR growth rates and trends
- Revenue by customer segment
- Expansion and churn analysis

Modern business intelligence tools can connect to your various data sources and create comprehensive revenue dashboards that update in real-time, helping you track performance and make data-driven decisions.

## Common revenue metric mistakes

**Including one-time fees in MRR**: Only recurring revenue should count toward MRR.

**Mixing recognized and contracted revenue**: Be clear about what you're measuring.

**Ignoring refunds and credits**: These should reduce your revenue calculations.

**Not segmenting revenue**: Understanding revenue by customer type, size, and industry is crucial.

**Focusing only on new revenue**: Expansion and retention are often more important for growth.

## Taking action on revenue metrics

**Slow MRR growth**: Focus on customer acquisition, pricing optimization, or expansion revenue.

**High customer concentration**: Diversify your customer base to reduce risk.

**Low ARPU**: Improve pricing, packaging, or target higher-value customers.

**Poor expansion revenue**: Invest in customer success and product development.
