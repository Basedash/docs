Unit economics determine whether your startup has a sustainable business model. These metrics show if you make more money from customers than it costs to acquire and serve them.

## Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**CAC** measures how much you spend to acquire each new paying customer.

### How to calculate

**CAC** = Total acquisition costs ÷ Number of new customers acquired

### What to include in acquisition costs

**Sales and marketing expenses**:
- Sales team salaries and commissions
- Marketing team salaries
- Advertising spend (paid search, social, display)
- Content creation and SEO costs
- Marketing tools and software
- Events and conferences
- Sales tools and CRM costs

### CAC by acquisition channel

Calculate CAC separately for each channel:
- **Paid search CAC** = Paid search costs ÷ Customers from paid search
- **Content marketing CAC** = Content costs ÷ Customers from organic search
- **Sales CAC** = Sales team costs ÷ Customers from direct sales

### CAC time period

Use the same time period for costs and customer acquisition:
- **Blended CAC**: All costs and customers from the same month
- **Cohort CAC**: Match costs to when customers were influenced (better for longer sales cycles)

### CAC benchmarks

- **B2B SaaS average**: $200-$1,500 depending on deal size
- **SMB SaaS**: $100-$500
- **Mid-market SaaS**: $500-$2,000
- **Enterprise SaaS**: $2,000-$10,000+

## Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**LTV** estimates the total revenue you'll earn from a customer over their entire relationship with your company.

### How to calculate

**Simple LTV** = ARPU ÷ Churn rate

**More accurate LTV** = ARPU × Gross margin % ÷ Churn rate

### Example calculation

- ARPU: $100/month
- Monthly churn rate: 5%
- Gross margin: 80%

**LTV** = $100 × 80% ÷ 5% = $1,600

### LTV considerations

**Gross margin**: Only count profit, not total revenue
**Churn rate**: Use cohort-based churn for accuracy
**Expansion revenue**: Include upsells and cross-sells
**Discount rate**: For long LTV periods, consider time value of money

### LTV by customer segment

Calculate LTV separately for:
- Customer size (SMB, mid-market, enterprise)
- Acquisition channel
- Customer cohorts (by signup month)
- Geographic regions

---

## LTV:CAC ratio

The **LTV:CAC ratio** shows how much lifetime value you get for every dollar spent on acquisition.

### How to calculate

**LTV:CAC ratio** = LTV ÷ CAC

### Benchmarks

- **3:1 minimum**: Break-even after covering operational costs
- **5:1 good**: Healthy, profitable growth
- **10:1+ concerning**: May indicate under-investment in growth

### What different ratios mean

**Under 1:1**: Losing money on every customer
**1:1 to 3:1**: Risky, little room for error
**3:1 to 5:1**: Good, sustainable growth
**5:1 to 10:1**: Great, efficient growth
**Over 10:1**: Potentially under-investing in growth

---

## CAC payback period

**CAC payback period** measures how long it takes to recover your customer acquisition investment.

### How to calculate

**CAC payback period** = CAC ÷ (ARPU × Gross margin %)

### Example calculation

- CAC: $500
- ARPU: $100/month
- Gross margin: 80%

**Payback period** = $500 ÷ ($100 × 80%) = 6.25 months

### Benchmarks

- **Under 12 months**: Excellent
- **12-18 months**: Good
- **18-24 months**: Acceptable for enterprise
- **Over 24 months**: Concerning for most SaaS businesses

### Why payback period matters

- **Cash flow impact**: Longer payback means more working capital needed
- **Risk assessment**: Shorter payback reduces customer loss risk
- **Growth planning**: Affects how fast you can reinvest in acquisition

---

## Gross margin

**Gross margin** measures the profitability of your core product after direct costs.

### How to calculate

**Gross margin** = (Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold) ÷ Revenue × 100

### SaaS Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)

**Direct costs only**:
- Hosting and infrastructure costs
- Third-party software licenses (per-user tools)
- Payment processing fees
- Customer support costs (if dedicated)
- Data costs (APIs, data providers)

**Don't include**:
- Sales and marketing costs
- General administrative costs
- Product development costs
- Customer success costs (usually)

### SaaS gross margin benchmarks

- **80%+**: Excellent for B2B SaaS
- **70-80%**: Good
- **60-70%**: Acceptable for early stage
- **Under 60%**: Concerning for SaaS model

### Improving gross margin

- **Reduce hosting costs**: Optimize infrastructure, use reserved instances
- **Negotiate better rates**: Volume discounts with vendors
- **Increase pricing**: Higher prices directly improve margins
- **Reduce support burden**: Better documentation, self-service options

---

## Contribution margin

**Contribution margin** goes beyond gross margin to include variable sales and marketing costs.

### How to calculate

**Contribution margin** = Revenue - COGS - Variable S&M costs

Variable S&M costs include:
- Sales commissions
- Marketing attribution costs
- Variable sales tools costs

### Why contribution margin matters

Shows the true profitability after all variable costs, giving a clearer picture of unit economics.

## Advanced unit economics

### Cohort-based LTV

Calculate LTV for specific customer cohorts to understand how unit economics change over time.

```
Month 1 cohort LTV vs Month 6 cohort LTV
```

### Blended vs segmented metrics

- **Blended**: Average across all customers
- **Segmented**: By customer size, channel, geography

Always analyze both blended and segmented metrics.

### CAC recovery curves

Track how quickly you recover CAC investment:
- Month 1: 20% recovered
- Month 6: 50% recovered
- Month 12: 100% recovered

## Improving unit economics

### Reduce CAC

**Optimize acquisition channels**:
- Focus on channels with lowest CAC
- Improve conversion rates
- Reduce sales cycle length
- Implement product-led growth

**Improve targeting**:
- Better qualify leads
- Focus on high-value customer segments
- Improve messaging and positioning

### Increase LTV

**Reduce churn**:
- Improve onboarding
- Better customer success
- Product improvements
- Pricing optimization

**Increase expansion revenue**:
- Upselling to higher plans
- Cross-selling additional products
- Usage-based pricing growth

### Improve payback period

- Everything that reduces CAC or increases early revenue
- Focus on faster time-to-value
- Improve customer onboarding
- Consider annual pricing incentives

---

## Unit economics tracking and analysis

### Data collection

Track unit economics with data from:
- CRM systems (lead and customer data)
- Financial systems (costs and revenue)
- Marketing tools (acquisition costs)
- Product analytics (usage and churn)

### Automated calculation

Set up dashboards that automatically calculate:
- CAC by channel and time period
- LTV by customer segment
- LTV:CAC ratios and trends
- Payback period analysis

Use business intelligence tools that can connect to multiple data sources and calculate these metrics automatically, updating in real-time as new data comes in.

### Review cadence

- **Weekly**: Monitor key trends and outliers
- **Monthly**: Deep dive into cohort analysis
- **Quarterly**: Strategic review and planning

## Common unit economics mistakes

**Including too much in CAC**: Don't include every marketing cost—focus on direct acquisition costs.

**Using wrong time periods**: Match acquisition costs with the customers they actually influenced.

**Ignoring cohorts**: Blended metrics can hide important trends.

**Not segmenting by channel**: Different channels have very different unit economics.

**Using oversimplified LTV**: Factor in churn curves, expansion revenue, and gross margins.

**Forgetting about cash flow**: Even with good unit economics, timing matters for cash flow.

## Taking action on unit economics

**High CAC**: Focus on conversion optimization, better targeting, or more efficient channels.

**Low LTV**: Improve product value, reduce churn, or increase expansion revenue.

**Long payback period**: Optimize onboarding, consider annual pricing, or improve early value delivery.

**Poor LTV:CAC ratio**: Either reduce acquisition costs or increase customer value.

Unit economics should drive your strategic decisions about pricing, customer segments, acquisition channels, and product development. Get these fundamentals right, and sustainable growth becomes much more achievable.
