Product metrics tell you how well your product delivers value to users. For B2B SaaS startups, these metrics are crucial for understanding product-market fit and predicting revenue growth.

## Daily and Weekly Active Users

**Daily Active Users (DAU)** and **Weekly Active Users (WAU)** measure how many unique users engage with your product in a given period.

### How to calculate

- **DAU**: Unique users who performed a meaningful action in your product today
- **WAU**: Unique users who performed a meaningful action in your product this week
- **DAU/WAU ratio**: DAU ÷ WAU (typically 0.2-0.6 for B2B SaaS)

### What counts as "active"

Don't just count logins. Define meaningful actions that indicate real product usage:
- Viewing key reports or dashboards
- Creating or editing content
- Completing core workflows
- Interacting with team members

### Why it matters

- Shows product stickiness and user engagement
- Predicts revenue retention and growth
- Identifies usage patterns and trends
- Helps with capacity planning and resource allocation

### Benchmarks

- **DAU/WAU ratio**: 0.2-0.6 for B2B SaaS (higher is better)
- **Growth rate**: 10-20% month-over-month for early-stage startups

## Monthly Active Users (MAU)

**Monthly Active Users** tracks unique users who engage with your product each month.

### How to calculate

Count unique users who performed meaningful actions in your product over a 30-day period.

### MAU vs paying customers

- **MAU** includes all active users (free and paid)
- **Paying MAU** only includes users from paying accounts
- Track both, but focus on paying MAU for revenue correlation

### Key insights

- Overall product adoption and reach
- Seasonal patterns and trends
- User acquisition effectiveness
- Product-led growth potential

## Session metrics

Understanding how users spend time in your product reveals engagement quality.

### Session duration

**Average session duration** = Total time spent ÷ Number of sessions

**What's good**:
- B2B tools: 10-30 minutes average
- Analytics/reporting tools: 5-15 minutes
- Communication tools: Throughout the workday

### Session frequency

**Average sessions per user per week** shows how often users return.

**What's good**:
- Daily use tools: 3-5 sessions per week
- Weekly use tools: 1-2 sessions per week
- Monthly use tools: 0.5-1 sessions per week

### Depth of engagement

Track how far users go in key workflows:
- Number of pages/screens viewed per session
- Actions completed per session
- Features used per session

---

## Feature adoption

Feature adoption shows which parts of your product deliver the most value.

### Adoption rate

**Feature adoption rate** = (Users who used feature ÷ Total users) × 100

### Time to adoption

How long it takes new users to discover and use key features.

### Feature stickiness

**Feature stickiness** = (DAU of feature ÷ MAU of feature) × 100

### Key insights

- Which features drive retention and engagement
- Where to focus product development efforts
- What features to highlight in onboarding
- Which features might be candidates for removal

---

## User activation metrics

Activation measures how quickly new users reach their "aha moment" and experience value.

### Activation rate

**Activation rate** = (Users who completed key actions ÷ New signups) × 100

### Time to activation

How long it takes new users to complete key onboarding steps.

### Activation milestones

Define specific actions that indicate activation:
- Completed profile setup
- Connected data source
- Created first dashboard
- Invited team member
- Used core feature

### Improving activation

- Reduce time to value
- Simplify onboarding flows
- Provide contextual help
- Show value early and often

---

## Engagement scoring

Create a composite score to measure overall user engagement.

### Simple engagement score

Assign points for key actions:
- Login: 1 point
- Core action: 3 points
- Advanced feature use: 5 points
- Collaboration: 7 points

### Engagement segments

Group users by engagement level:
- **Champions** (90-100 points): Your most engaged users
- **Regulars** (50-89 points): Solid, consistent users
- **Explorers** (20-49 points): Occasional users
- **Dormant** (0-19 points): At-risk users

---

## Cohort analysis for product metrics

Track how different user groups behave over time.

### Usage cohorts

Group users by when they first used your product and track their engagement over time.

### Feature cohorts

Group users by when they first used specific features and track ongoing usage.

### Insights from cohorts

- How user behavior changes over time
- Which onboarding improvements worked best
- Seasonal patterns in product usage
- Long-term engagement trends

---

## Setting up product metrics tracking

### Choose your events carefully

Don't track everything. Focus on events that:
- Indicate real product value
- Correlate with revenue and retention
- Help you make product decisions
- Are consistent and reliable

### Implement event tracking

Most startups use tools like:
- Mixpanel or Amplitude for product analytics
- Google Analytics for web behavior
- Custom tracking for specific business logic

### Create automated dashboards

Build dashboards that update automatically and show:
- Daily/weekly active users trending
- Feature adoption rates
- User engagement scores
- Key metrics by user segment

Consider using a business intelligence tool that can connect to your product analytics and create custom dashboards tailored to your startup's specific needs.

### Review cadence

- **Daily**: Check DAU and any critical metrics
- **Weekly**: Review WAU, engagement trends, and feature adoption
- **Monthly**: Deep dive into cohort analysis and long-term trends

## Common mistakes with product metrics

**Counting vanity actions**: Don't track meaningless actions like page views or clicks that don't indicate real value.

**Ignoring user segments**: B2B products often have different user types (admins, end users, viewers) with different engagement patterns.

**Over-optimizing for engagement**: High engagement doesn't always mean business success. Balance engagement with revenue metrics.

**Not defining clear activation criteria**: Without clear activation milestones, you can't optimize the user journey effectively.

## Taking action on product metrics

**Low activation rates**: Focus on onboarding improvements and time-to-value reduction.

**Declining engagement**: Look for product issues, competitor threats, or changing user needs.

**Poor feature adoption**: Improve discoverability, add contextual help, or consider feature removal.

**Engagement doesn't translate to revenue**: Review your pricing model and upgrade prompts.
