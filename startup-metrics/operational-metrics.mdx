Operational metrics help you understand the health and efficiency of your startup's internal operations. These metrics ensure you're building a sustainable business that can scale effectively.

## Financial health metrics

### Burn rate

**Monthly burn rate** is how much cash your startup spends each month.

**Gross burn rate** = Total monthly expenses

**Net burn rate** = Monthly expenses - Monthly revenue

**Example calculation**:
- Monthly expenses: $100K
- Monthly revenue: $30K
- **Net burn rate**: $70K/month

### Runway

**Runway** is how long your startup can operate before running out of cash.

**Runway** = Cash in bank ÷ Monthly net burn rate

**Example calculation**:
- Cash in bank: $500K
- Monthly net burn rate: $50K
- **Runway**: 10 months

### Burn efficiency

**Burn multiple** = Net cash burned ÷ Net new ARR

**Example calculation**:
- Net cash burned this quarter: $300K
- Net new ARR added: $100K
- **Burn multiple**: 3x

**Benchmarks**:
- **Under 1.5x**: Exceptional efficiency
- **1.5x - 2.5x**: Good efficiency
- **2.5x - 4x**: Acceptable
- **Over 4x**: Concerning

### Capital efficiency

**Months to profitability**: Based on current growth and burn trends

**Revenue per dollar raised**: How much ARR you generate per dollar of funding

**Growth capital efficiency**: Revenue growth per dollar of incremental spend

**Benchmarks for B2B SaaS**:
- **Early stage**: $100K - $200K per employee
