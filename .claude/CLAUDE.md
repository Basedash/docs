# BASEDASH DOCS DEVELOPMENT GUIDE

This is the documentation site for Basedash, an AI-native business intelligence platform.

## Content Format

Documentation files use **MDX** (Markdown with JSX) format, which allows you to use React components within markdown files.

## Available Components

Mintlify provides built-in MDX components for documentation pages. These components can be used to structure content, draw attention to important information, document APIs, and guide navigation.

For a complete list of available built-in components and their usage, see the [Mintlify Components Documentation](https://www.mintlify.com/docs/components).

## Development

- `mintlify dev`: Start the local development server (typically runs on localhost:3000)
