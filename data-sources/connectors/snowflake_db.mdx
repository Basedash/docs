## Overview

Snowflake is available as a data source via Basedash Warehouse. This allows you to sync your Snowflake data into a centralized warehouse managed by Basedash.

2. Select "Add data source"
3. Search for "Snowflake"
4. Select Snowflake and follow the setup flow through Fivetran

## Table and column comments

Basedash automatically pulls in table and column comments from your Snowflake database. These comments provide valuable context to the AI about your data structure and are used to generate more accurate queries and insights.
