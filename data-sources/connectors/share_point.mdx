## Overview

SharePoint is available as a data source via Basedash Warehouse. This allows you to sync your SharePoint data into a centralized warehouse managed by Basedash.

## Excel Files and Enterprise Use

SharePoint is the recommended connector for enterprise customers working with Excel files, especially those using Microsoft 365 environments. This connector:

- Provides seamless integration with existing Microsoft analytics workflows
- Offers enterprise-grade access controls and permissions
- Is the preferred method for legacy enterprises that default to Microsoft tools
- Supports better collaboration and version control for shared Excel files

> **Note**: If you're an individual user or small team working with personal Excel files, you may want to consider the [OneDrive connector](/data-sources/connectors/one_drive) instead.

## Setup

1. In Basedash, open the command menu (⌘K) and open "Data sources"
2. Select "Add data source"
3. Search for "SharePoint"
4. Select SharePoint and follow the setup flow through Fivetran

## Documentation

For detailed information about the SharePoint connector, including schema information and sync behavior, see the [Fivetran SharePoint documentation](https://fivetran.com/docs/connectors/files/share-point).
