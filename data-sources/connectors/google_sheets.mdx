## Overview

Google Sheets is available as a data source via Basedash Warehouse. This allows you to sync your Google Sheets data into a centralized warehouse managed by Basedash.

## Connection Options

When connecting to Google Sheets, you'll have two options:

1. **Multiple Sheets Connection (Recommended)**: If you need to connect multiple sheets that should be treated as a schema, we recommend using the [Google Drive connector](/data-sources/connectors/google_drive). This approach:
   - Allows you to connect all sheets in a folder at once
   - Eliminates the need for named ranges or table reformatting
   - Provides a more efficient way to work with multiple related sheets
   - Maintains the original structure of your data

2. **Single Sheet Connection (Limited)**: Connect to a specific Google Sheet. This method:
   - Requires setting up named ranges in your sheet
   - Only supports connecting one sheet at a time
   - May require reformatting your data to work properly
   - Is best used only when you have a single, isolated sheet that doesn't need to be part of a larger schema

## Common Use Cases

The single sheet connection is most useful for the following scenarios:

### Complex Single-Sheet Analysis
- Connect a detailed financial model with multiple tabs
- Analyze a comprehensive project timeline or Gantt chart
- Work with a complex data analysis sheet with multiple pivot tables
- Example: A detailed budget model with multiple scenarios and what-if analyses

### Standalone Reports
- Connect a monthly or quarterly report
- Analyze a single dataset that doesn't need to be combined with others
- Work with a self-contained dashboard
- Example: A monthly sales report with embedded charts and analysis

### Data Collection Forms
- Connect a Google Form response sheet
- Analyze survey results from a single form
- Work with a standalone data entry sheet
- Example: A customer feedback form response sheet

### Quick Analysis
- Connect a single sheet for ad-hoc analysis
- Work with a temporary or experimental dataset
- Analyze data that doesn't need to be part of a larger schema
- Example: A quick market research analysis or competitor comparison

## Setup

1. In Basedash, open the command menu (âŒ˜K) and open "Data sources"
2. Select "Add data source"
3. Search for "Google Sheets"
4. Select Google Sheets and follow the setup flow through Fivetran
5. Choose whether you want to connect a single sheet or multiple sheets
   - For multiple sheets, you'll be guided to use the [Google Drive connector](/data-sources/connectors/google_drive) instead
