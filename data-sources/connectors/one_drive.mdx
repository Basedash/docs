## Overview

OneDrive is available as a data source via Basedash Warehouse. This allows you to sync your OneDrive data into a centralized warehouse managed by Basedash.

## Connection Options

When connecting Excel files, you'll have two options:

1. **SharePoint Connection (Recommended for Enterprise)**: For enterprise customers and organizations using Microsoft 365, we recommend using the [SharePoint connector](/data-sources/connectors/share_point). This approach:
   - Provides better integration with enterprise Microsoft environments
   - Offers more robust access controls and permissions management
   - Is the preferred method for legacy enterprises that default to Microsoft tools
   - Integrates seamlessly with existing Microsoft analytics workflows
   - Supports better collaboration and version control for shared Excel files

2. **OneDrive Connection (Personal/Small Teams)**: Connect to Excel files stored in OneDrive. This method:
   - Works well for personal or small team Excel files
   - Is suitable for individual users or small organizations
   - Provides direct access to files in your personal OneDrive storage

## Setup

1. In Basedash, open the command menu (⌘K) and open "Data sources"
2. Select "Add data source"
3. Search for "OneDrive"
4. Select OneDrive and follow the setup flow through Fivetran
