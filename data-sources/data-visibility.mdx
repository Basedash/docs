Basedash provides comprehensive data visibility controls that allow you to hide tables, schemas, and columns from AI access across your entire organization. When hidden, these data sources become completely inaccessible to queries and are treated as if they don't exist.

## How data hiding works

When you hide a table, schema, or column in Basedash:

- **AI cannot write queries** that reference the hidden data
- **No queries can functionally fetch data** from hidden sources
- **Hidden data appears as if it doesn't exist** to all users in your organization
- **Changes apply organization-wide** - all team members are affected

This is particularly useful for:
- Hiding sensitive or internal data
- Removing deprecated tables from AI suggestions
- Controlling what data the AI can analyze
- Maintaining data governance and compliance

## Hiding tables

To hide an entire table:

1. Navigate to **Data sources** in your Basedash workspace
2. Select the data source containing the table you want to hide
3. In the left panel, locate the table in the schemas/tables list
4. Right-click on the table name to open the context menu
5. Select **Hide table** from the context menu (marked with a crossed-out eye icon)
6. The table is now hidden from all AI access

The screenshot below shows the context menu for hiding a table, with the "Hide table" option highlighted:

## Hiding schemas

To hide an entire schema:

1. Navigate to **Data sources** in your Basedash workspace
2. Select the data source containing the schema you want to hide
3. In the left panel, locate the schema in the schemas list
4. Look for the **Hide schema** button next to the schema name, or the crossed-out eye icon
5. Click the **Hide schema** button to hide the entire schema
6. All tables and columns within that schema will be hidden from AI access

The screenshot below shows the schema hiding interface with the "Hide schema" button:

## Hiding columns

To hide specific columns within a table:

1. Navigate to **Data sources** in your Basedash workspace
2. Select the data source and table containing the column
3. In the table management panel, scroll to the **Columns** section
4. Find the specific column you want to hide
5. Look for the hide/show toggle (eye icon) next to the column
6. Click the eye icon to hide the column
7. The column is now hidden from AI access

The screenshot below shows the table settings modal with column visibility controls:

## Managing hidden data

### Viewing hidden items
Hidden tables, schemas, and columns are typically marked with visual indicators:
- Hidden tables show a crossed-out eye icon
- Hidden columns may show a different icon or styling
- The **Hidden** toggle will be in the "on" position

### Unhiding data
To make hidden data visible again:
1. Navigate to the hidden item in the data sources section
2. For tables: Right-click and select **Hide table** again to toggle visibility
3. For schemas: Click the **Hide schema** button again to toggle visibility
4. For columns: Click the eye icon again to toggle visibility
5. The data will immediately become accessible to AI again

## Best practices

### Data governance
- **Document your hiding decisions** - keep track of why certain data is hidden
- **Regular reviews** - periodically review hidden items to ensure they're still necessary
- **Team communication** - inform your team about what data has been hidden and why

### Security considerations
- **Sensitive data** - hide tables containing PII, financial information, or internal metrics
- **Test data** - hide development or testing tables that shouldn't be analyzed
- **Deprecated data** - hide old tables that are no longer maintained

### Performance optimization
- **Unused tables** - hide tables that are no longer actively used
- **Large datasets** - consider hiding very large tables that could impact query performance
- **Experimental data** - hide tables that are still in development

## Troubleshooting

### AI still references hidden data
If the AI continues to reference hidden data:
- Ensure the hiding toggle is properly set
- Check if you're working with a cached version of the data source
- Verify that the change has been applied across your organization

### Can't find hiding controls
If you can't locate the hiding options:
- Ensure you have the appropriate permissions in your organization
- Check if your data source supports data hiding
- Contact your Basedash administrator for assistance

### Hidden data still appearing in queries
If hidden data appears in existing queries:
- Hidden data only affects new AI-generated queries
- Existing saved queries may still reference hidden data
- Review and update any saved queries that reference hidden sources
