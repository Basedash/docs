Basedash offers flexible options for connecting your data, allowing you to either use your existing data warehouse or let us manage the infrastructure for you.

## Basedash Warehouse

The simplest way to get started is to use Basedash Warehouse, our fully-managed Postgres data warehouse. With this option, you can:

- Skip the complex setup of managing your own data warehouse
- Connect data from 600+ sources through our Fivetran integration
- Let us handle all infrastructure, backups, and maintenance
- Get started immediately with no technical expertise required

## Connect your own warehouse

If you already have a data warehouse, you can connect it directly to Basedash. We support major data warehouses and databases including:

- BigQuery
- Snowflake
- ClickHouse

You can also connect your own SQL database, either by syncing it to Basedash Warehouse or by connecting it directly.
