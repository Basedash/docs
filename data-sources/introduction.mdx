Basedash offers flexible options for connecting your data, allowing you to either use your existing data warehouse or let us manage the infrastructure for you.

## Basedash Warehouse

The simplest way to get started is to use [Basedash Warehouse](/data-sources/warehouses/basedash-warehouse), our fully-managed [PostgreSQL](/data-sources/databases/postgres) data warehouse. With this option, you can:

- Skip the complex setup of managing your own data warehouse
- Connect data from 600+ sources through our [Fivetran](/data-sources/connectors/fivetran_log) integration
- Let us handle all infrastructure, backups, and maintenance
- Get started immediately with no technical expertise required

## Connect your own warehouse

If you already have a data warehouse, you can connect it directly to Basedash. We support major data warehouses and databases including:

- [BigQuery](/data-sources/warehouses/bigquery)
- [Snowflake](/data-sources/warehouses/snowflake)
- [ClickHouse](/data-sources/warehouses/clickhouse)

You can also connect your own SQL database, either by syncing it to [Basedash Warehouse](/data-sources/warehouses/basedash-warehouse) or by connecting it directly to Basedash.

## Self-hosting for complete data sovereignty

For organizations that need complete control over their data infrastructure, we offer [self-hosting](/self-hosting/overview) as an option. Self-hosted deployments allow you to:

- Deploy Basedash on your own infrastructure
- Maintain complete control over data storage and location
- Meet specific compliance and regulatory requirements
- Operate in air-gapped or highly secure environments

Self-hosted customers typically bring their own data warehouses and connect them directly to their Basedash deployment.
