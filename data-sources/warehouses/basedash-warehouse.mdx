1. From your Basedash dashboard, click "Add Data Source"
2. Choose from available [Fivetran connectors](/data-sources/connectors) or database syncing options
3. Configure authentication and sync settings
4. Start your first data sync

The warehouse will be automatically created and configured during this process.

### 2. Begin analyzing
1. Wait for initial data sync to complete
2. Use the [chat interface](/features/chat) to explore your data
3. Create your first [charts and dashboards](/features/charts)
4. Set up automated [reports](/features/reports)

## Data management and deletion

### Data retention and deletion
Basedash Warehouse follows soft deletion practices to maintain data integrity:

- **Soft deletion** - When data sources are removed, data is marked as deleted but preserved in the warehouse
- **Fivetran data integrity** - This ensures that Fivetran can maintain proper sync history and data lineage
- **Automatic cleanup** - Removed data sources are automatically deleted after 30 days
- **Manual deletion** - You can request immediate deletion of data sources if needed
- **Global context filtering** - The AI automatically filters out deleted data from Fivetran when processing queries, ensuring you only see active, relevant data

### Data source removal
When you remove a data source from Basedash:

1. **Immediate effect** - The data source is marked as inactive and stops syncing new data
2. **Data preservation** - Existing data remains in the warehouse for 30 days
3. **Automatic deletion** - After 30 days, the data source and its data are automatically removed
4. **Manual override** - Contact support to request immediate deletion if required

### Credential access and control
All workspaces have full access to their warehouse credentials:

- **Self-service access** - View and manage your warehouse connection details
- **External service integration** - Use credentials to connect other tools and services to your warehouse
- **Authentication control** - Manage who can access your warehouse data
- **Credential rotation** - Update credentials as needed for security

### AI data filtering
Basedash's AI automatically handles deleted data from Fivetran:

- **Automatic filtering** - When you query your data, the AI automatically excludes records marked as deleted in Fivetran
- **Global context awareness** - The AI understands Fivetran's deletion patterns and applies appropriate filters
- **Seamless experience** - You don't need to manually filter out deleted data - it's handled automatically
- **Data consistency** - Ensures your queries and charts only show active, relevant data

## Next steps
