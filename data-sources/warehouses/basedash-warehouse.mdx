## Getting started

### Automatic warehouse provisioning

When you add any data source that requires Basedash Warehouse, we automatically provision a warehouse for you. There's no manual setup required - the warehouse is created and configured automatically.

### 1. Add your first data source

1. From your Basedash dashboard, click "Add Data Source"
2. Choose from available [Fivetran connectors](/data-sources/connectors) or database syncing options
3. Configure authentication and sync settings
4. Start your first data sync

The warehouse will be automatically created and configured during this process.

### 2. Begin analyzing

1. Wait for initial data sync to complete
2. Use the [chat interface](/features/chat) to explore your data
3. Create your first [charts and dashboards](/features/charts)
4. Set up automated [alerts](/features/alerts)

## Best practices

## Data management and deletion

### Data retention and deletion

Basedash Warehouse follows soft deletion practices to maintain data integrity:

- **Soft deletion** - When data sources are removed, data is marked as deleted but preserved in the warehouse
- **Fivetran data integrity** - This ensures that Fivetran can maintain proper sync history and data lineage
- **Automatic cleanup** - Removed data sources are automatically deleted after 30 days
- **Manual deletion** - You can request immediate deletion of data sources if needed
- **Global context filtering** - The AI automatically filters out deleted data from Fivetran when processing queries, ensuring you only see active, relevant data

### Data source removal

When you remove a data source from Basedash:

1. **Immediate effect** - The data source is marked as inactive and stops syncing new data
2. **Data preservation** - Existing data remains in the warehouse for 30 days
3. **Automatic deletion** - After 30 days, the data source and its data are automatically removed
4. **Manual override** - Contact support to request immediate deletion if required

### Credential access and control

All workspaces have full access to their warehouse credentials:

- **Self-service access** - View and manage your warehouse connection details
- **External service integration** - Use credentials to connect other tools and services to your warehouse
- **Authentication control** - Manage who can access your warehouse data
- **Credential rotation** - Update credentials as needed for security

## Accessing your warehouse credentials

You can access your Basedash Warehouse credentials directly from the app to connect external tools, run custom queries, or manage your data. Useful for things you can't do within Basedash, like deleting data.

### How to view your credentials

1. Open the command menu (Cmd+K or Ctrl+K)
2. Type "Basedash Warehouse"
3. Select "View credentials"

Your credentials include:

- **Host** - The database server address
- **Port** - The connection port (typically 5432)
- **Database** - Your database name
- **Username** - Your database username
- **Password** - Your database password

<Note>
  You must have at least one Fivetran connection set up through Basedash
  Warehouse for this option to be available.
</Note>

### AI data filtering

Basedash's AI automatically handles deleted data from Fivetran:

- **Automatic filtering** - When you query your data, the AI automatically excludes records marked as deleted in Fivetran
- **Global context awareness** - The AI understands Fivetran's deletion patterns and applies appropriate filters
- **Seamless experience** - You don't need to manually filter out deleted data - it's handled automatically
- **Data consistency** - Ensures your queries and charts only show active, relevant data

## Next steps

Once your Basedash Warehouse is set up, you can:

- **Explore your data** - Use natural language to query your warehouse
- [**Build dashboards**](/features/dashboards) - Create visualizations and [alerts](/features/alerts)
