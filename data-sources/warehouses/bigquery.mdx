Connect your Google BigQuery data warehouse to Basedash to analyze and visualize your enterprise data.

## Prerequisites
- A Google Cloud project with BigQuery enabled
- Service account with BigQuery access
- Service account key file (JSON)
- Relevant dataset permissions

## Connection setup
1. From your Basedash dashboard, click "Add Data Source"
2. Select "BigQuery" as your data warehouse
3. Upload your service account key file
4. Select or enter your project ID
5. Choose default dataset (optional)
6. Click "Test Connection" to verify
7. Save your connection

## Required permissions
Your service account needs the following IAM roles:
- `roles/bigquery.dataViewer` - to read data
- `roles/bigquery.jobUser` - to run queries
- `roles/bigquery.resourceViewer` - to list projects and datasets

## Best practices
- Create a dedicated service account for Basedash
- Grant minimum required permissions
- Regularly rotate service account keys
- Use table partitioning for large datasets
- Set appropriate query cost limits

## Performance optimization
- Use clustered and partitioned tables
- Materialize commonly used views
- Create appropriate table statistics
- Monitor query costs and performance
- Set up appropriate caching policies

## Troubleshooting
- Verify service account permissions
- Check if datasets are accessible
- Monitor query quotas and limits
- Review BigQuery audit logs for errors
