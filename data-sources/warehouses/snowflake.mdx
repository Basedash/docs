Connect your Snowflake data warehouse to Basedash to analyze and visualize your enterprise data.

## Prerequisites
- A Snowflake account
- User credentials with appropriate access
- Account identifier (organization-account.region)
- Warehouse, database, and schema information

## Connection setup
1. From your Basedash dashboard, click "Add Data Source"
2. Select "Snowflake" as your data warehouse
3. Enter your connection details:
   - Account identifier
   - Username
   - Password
   - Warehouse name
   - Database name
   - Schema (optional)
   - Role (optional)
4. Click "Test Connection" to verify
5. Save your connection

## Required permissions
Your Snowflake user needs:
- `USAGE` on warehouse
- `USAGE` on database
- `USAGE` on schema
- `SELECT` on required tables
- `MONITOR` on warehouse (recommended)

## Best practices
- Create a dedicated user for Basedash
- Use appropriate warehouse sizing
- Grant minimum required permissions
- Set resource monitors for cost control
- Regularly rotate credentials

## Performance optimization
- Choose appropriate warehouse size
- Use clustering keys for large tables
- Leverage materialized views
- Set up proper table maintenance
- Configure query timeouts
- Enable result caching

## Troubleshooting
- Verify user permissions
- Check warehouse availability
- Monitor credit usage
- Review query history for errors
- Validate network access

## Next steps: Add custom context

You can add custom context to help the AI better understand your data structure and business logic. Consider adding context at the database or schema level if you notice the AI struggling to locate or understand specific data.

### When to add context
- **Complex transformed data**: When the AI needs help understanding data transformation logic
- **Business-specific metrics**: If calculated fields or KPIs need additional explanation
- **Unclear naming conventions**: When table or column names don't clearly indicate their purpose

For detailed guidance, see our [custom context documentation](/features/custom-context).
