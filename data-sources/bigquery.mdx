## Overview

Google BigQuery is a fully-managed, serverless data warehouse that enables scalable analysis over petabytes of data. With a powerful SQL interface and fast query performance, BigQuery is designed for analyzing massive datasets with ease.

Connecting BigQuery to Basedash Charts allows you to create beautiful visualizations and dashboards from your data warehouse without moving your data.

## Connection Requirements

To connect your BigQuery data warehouse to Basedash Charts, you'll need:

- **Google Cloud Project ID**: The ID of your Google Cloud project
- **Dataset**: The BigQuery dataset you want to analyze
- **Authentication**: Service account credentials with appropriate permissions

For authentication, you can use:
- **Service Account Key**: A JSON key file for a service account with BigQuery access
- **OAuth**: Connect using your Google account credentials (for personal projects)

For security best practices, we recommend:
- Creating a dedicated service account with minimal permissions
- Granting only the necessary dataset access
- Regularly rotating service account keys

## Connection Steps

1. From your Basedash Charts dashboard, click on "Add Data Source"
2. Select "BigQuery" from the list of available data sources
3. Enter your connection details:
   - Project ID
   - Dataset (optional)
   - Upload your service account key file or authenticate via OAuth
4. Click "Test Connection" to verify your settings
5. Once successful, click "Add Data Source"
