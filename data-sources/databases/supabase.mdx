Supabase is built on top of Postgres, so connecting your Supabase database to Basedash is straightforward. You'll need your database connection details from your Supabase project settings.

## Connection URI (recommended)

The easiest way to connect is by using the connection string (URI) method. In Basedash, press <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> and paste your connection string to start the connection flow immediately.

Example (Transaction Pooler):
```
postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@<project-id>.supabase.co:6543/postgres
```

> **Note:** The password is not visible in the Supabase dashboard. Make sure you have access to itâ€”this may be stored in a password manager like [1Password](https://1password.com/) or [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/), or you may need to contact a teammate who has the credentials.

> **Tip:** Labels and connection methods may differ depending on your hosting provider (GCP, AWS, DigitalOcean, etc.). Always check your provider's documentation for the latest info.

After clicking the ["Connect" button in your Supabase project dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/), you'll see options for Direct connection, Transaction pooler, and Session pooler. Always use the Transaction Pooler (port 6543) for best performance and compatibility with Basedash.

## Manual connection details

If you prefer to enter credentials manually, use the following details (from the Transaction Pooler section):

1. Go to your [Supabase project dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/)
2. Click on the "Connect" button in the header
3. In the Transaction Pooler section, use these details:
   - Host: `[your-project-id].supabase.co`
   - Port: `6543` (Transaction Pooler port)
   - Database name: `postgres`
   - Username: Your database username
   - Password: Your database password

> **Important**: Always use the Transaction Pooler connection method (port 6543) instead of direct connection (port 5432). The Transaction Pooler provides better connection management and performance for your database queries.
