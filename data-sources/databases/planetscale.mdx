Connect your PlanetScale database to Basedash to visualize and analyze your application data.

## Connection URI (recommended)

The easiest way to connect is by using the connection string (URI) method. In Basedash, press <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> and paste your connection string to start the connection flow immediately.

Example:
```
mysql://[USERNAME]:[PASSWORD]@[HOST]/[DATABASE]?sslmode=require
```

> **Note:** The password is not always visible in your database dashboard. Make sure you have access to itâ€”this may be stored in a password manager like [1Password](https://1password.com/) or [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/), or you may need to contact a teammate who has the credentials.

> **Tip:** Labels and connection methods may differ depending on your hosting provider (GCP, AWS, DigitalOcean, etc.). Always check your provider's documentation for the latest info.

## Manual connection details

If you prefer to enter credentials manually, use the following details:

1. From your Basedash dashboard, click "Add Data Source"
2. Select "PlanetScale" as your database type
3. Enter your connection details:
   - Host (from PlanetScale connection string)
   - Database name
   - Username

   - SSL mode (required)
4. Click "Test Connection" to verify
5. Save your connection
