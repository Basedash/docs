## Overview

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development. Known for reliability, feature robustness, and performance, PostgreSQL is a popular choice for applications of all sizes.

With Basedash Charts, you can connect directly to your PostgreSQL database to visualize data from your product, like signups, customers, and business metrics.

## Connection Requirements

To connect your PostgreSQL database to Basedash Charts, you'll need:

- **Host**: Your database hostname or IP address
- **Port**: The port your PostgreSQL server is running on (default: 5432)
- **Database name**: The name of your database
- **Username**: A database user with appropriate read permissions
- **Password**: The password for the database user

For security best practices, we recommend:
- Creating a read-only user specifically for Basedash
- Using SSL connections
- Restricting access by IP address (Basedash server IP: `24.199.77.73`)

## Connection Steps

1. From your Basedash Charts dashboard, click on "Add Data Source"
2. Select "PostgreSQL" from the list of available data sources
3. Enter your connection details:
   - Host
   - Port
   - Database name
   - Username
   - Password
4. Click "Test Connection" to verify your settings
5. Once successful, click "Add Data Source"

### SSH Tunnel Connection

If your database is behind a firewall, you can connect using an SSH tunnel:

1. Select the "Connect via SSH" option when adding your data source
2. Provide your SSH server details:
   - SSH Host
   - SSH Port (default: 22)
   - SSH Username
   - Authentication method (Password or SSH Key)

- **Business Intelligence**: Analyze revenue, customer acquisition costs, and other business metrics
- **Operational Monitoring**: Track system performance, error rates, and other operational metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

- **Connection Refused**: Verify your PostgreSQL server is running and accessible from the internet
- **Authentication Failed**: Double-check your username and password
- **Database Not Found**: Verify the database name exists on your server
- **SSL Required**: If your server requires SSL, ensure the "Use SSL" option is enabled

### Performance Optimization

- Create indexes on frequently queried columns
- Use materialized views for complex queries
- Consider query timeouts for long-running queries
- Limit the amount of data returned by using appropriate WHERE clauses
