description: 'Connect your PostgreSQL database to Basedash'
---

Connect your PostgreSQL database to Basedash to visualize and analyze your application data.

## Prerequisites
- A PostgreSQL database (version 10 or higher)
- Database credentials with read access
- Database host and port information
- If using SSL: SSL certificate information
- If using SSH tunnel: SSH credentials and host information

## Connection methods

### Direct connection
1. From your Basedash dashboard, click "Add Data Source"
2. Select "PostgreSQL" as your database type
3. Enter your connection details:
   - Host (e.g., `localhost` or `your-db.host.com`)
   - Port (default: 5432)
   - Database name
   - Username
   - Password
   - SSL mode (if required)
4. Click "Test Connection" to verify
5. Save your connection

### SSH tunnel
For enhanced security when your database is in a private network:
1. Follow the direct connection steps above
2. Enable "Connect via SSH" option
3. Add our IP (`24.199.77.73`) to your allowlist
4. Provide SSH connection details:
   - SSH host
   - SSH username
   - Authentication method (password or key)
5. Test and save the connection

## Best practices
- Use a read-only database user for Basedash
- Enable SSL for secure connections
- Consider using an SSH tunnel for databases in private networks
- Regularly rotate database credentials
- Monitor query performance and set appropriate limits

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure your database user has SELECT permissions on required schemas
- Check if your database host allows external connections
- Verify firewall rules allow connections from Basedash IP
- For SSL issues, verify certificate configuration
- For connection issues, check database logs for error messages
