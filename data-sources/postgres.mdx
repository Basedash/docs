Connect your PostgreSQL database to Basedash to visualize and manage your product data seamlessly. Follow these simple steps to get started.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Gather Connection Details">
    You'll need the following information to connect your PostgreSQL database:

    - Database name
    - Username
    - Password
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Network Access">
