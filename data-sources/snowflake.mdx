## Overview

Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehousing platform that provides a single, integrated solution for data storage, processing, and analytics. With its unique architecture that separates compute from storage, Snowflake offers virtually unlimited scalability, concurrency, and performance.

Connecting Snowflake to Basedash Charts allows you to create powerful visualizations from your enterprise data warehouse without the complexity of traditional BI tools.

## Connection Requirements

To connect your Snowflake data warehouse to Basedash Charts, you'll need:

- **Account**: Your Snowflake account identifier (e.g., `xy12345.us-east-1.aws.snowflakecomputing.com`)
- **Warehouse**: The name of the Snowflake warehouse to use for queries
- **Database**: The Snowflake database you want to analyze
- **Schema**: The schema within the database (default: `PUBLIC`)
- **Username**: A Snowflake user with appropriate access permissions
- **Password**: The password for the Snowflake user
- **Role** (optional): The Snowflake role to use for queries

For security best practices, we recommend:
- Creating a dedicated read-only user for Basedash
- Assigning appropriate role-based access controls
- Setting resource monitors on the warehouse used for analytics

## Connection Steps

1. From your Basedash Charts dashboard, click on "Add Data Source"
2. Select "Snowflake" from the list of available data sources
3. Enter your connection details:
   - Account
   - Warehouse
   - Database
   - Schema
   - Username
   - Password
   - Role (optional)
4. Click "Test Connection" to verify your settings
5. Once successful, click "Add Data Source"
