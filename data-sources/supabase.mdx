## Overview

Supabase is an open-source Firebase alternative that provides a PostgreSQL database, authentication, instant APIs, real-time subscriptions, and storage. Built on top of PostgreSQL, Supabase offers a powerful and flexible database solution with the simplicity of a modern development platform.

With Basedash Charts, you can connect directly to your Supabase database to visualize data from your product, like signups, customers, and business metrics.

## Connection Requirements

To connect your Supabase database to Basedash Charts, you'll need:

- **Port**: The port for your PostgreSQL connection (default: 5432)
- **Database name**: The name of your Supabase database (usually "postgres")
- **Username**: Your Supabase database username
- **Password**: Your Supabase database password

You can find these connection details in your Supabase dashboard under Project Settings > Database > Connection string > Connection parameters.

For security best practices, we recommend:
