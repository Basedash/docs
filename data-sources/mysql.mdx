## Overview

MySQL is one of the world's most popular open-source relational database management systems. Known for its reliability, ease of use, and performance, MySQL powers millions of web applications, from small personal projects to large enterprise systems.

With Basedash Charts, you can connect directly to your MySQL database to visualize data from your product, like signups, customers, and business metrics.
