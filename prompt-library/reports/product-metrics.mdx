Track daily product engagement metrics to understand how users interact with your product. This report helps product teams make data-driven decisions and quickly identify issues or opportunities.

```
Create a daily product metrics report covering:

1. Engagement Metrics:
   - Daily Active Users (DAU) and Weekly Active Users (WAU)
   - DAU/MAU ratio (stickiness)
   - Average session duration and sessions per user
   - Comparison to 7-day and 30-day averages

2. Feature Usage:
   - Top 10 most-used features with usage counts
   - New feature adoption rates
   - Features with declining usage
   - Feature usage by user segment (free vs. paid, new vs. established)

3. User Actions:
   - Key actions completed (e.g., projects created, reports generated, exports completed)
   - Conversion rates for critical user flows
   - Drop-off points in key funnels

4. Performance & Quality:
   - Error rates and types
   - Page load times and performance metrics
   - User-reported issues or bugs

5. Cohort Behavior:
   - Retention rate for users who signed up 7, 14, and 30 days ago
   - Activation rate for new users

Highlight any significant changes (>20% day-over-day) and provide context for unusual patterns. Include recommendations for product improvements or areas requiring investigation.
