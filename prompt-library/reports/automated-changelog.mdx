Automatically generate product changelogs based on recently merged GitHub pull requests. This report saves time and keeps stakeholders informed about product updates and improvements.

```
Generate a product changelog for the past week based on merged GitHub pull requests:

1. Scan all PRs merged to the main branch in the past 7 days
2. Categorize changes into: New Features, Improvements, Bug Fixes, and Technical Updates
3. For each change, provide:
   - A user-friendly description (rewrite technical PR titles for clarity)
   - The PR number and link
   - The team member who implemented it
4. Exclude internal/infrastructure changes that don't affect users
5. Highlight any breaking changes or important updates that require user action
6. Include a summary section at the top with the total number of changes by category

Format the changelog in a clean, readable style suitable for sharing with customers or posting to a changelog page.
```
