Perform deep analysis on recent signups to identify companies that match your ideal customer profile and warrant sales outreach. This prompt combines internal data with external research to prioritize your sales efforts.

```
Look through all of the companies that signed up to our product in the past 30 days and do a deep dive into each of the companies online. Research their industry, company size, funding status, and recent news. List any companies in our ICP (B2B SaaS companies with 50-500 employees, Series A or later funding, and active product development) that we should set up a sales call with. For each company, provide a brief summary of why they're a good fit and any relevant talking points for the sales team.
