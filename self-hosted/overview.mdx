Self-hosting allows you to deploy Basedash on your own infrastructure, giving you complete control over your data, security policies, and deployment environment. This option is ideal for organizations with strict compliance requirements, air-gapped environments, or those who prefer to manage their own infrastructure.

## What you control

When you self-host Basedash, you maintain full control over:
- Data storage and location
- Network security and access controls
- Deployment infrastructure
- Updates and maintenance schedules
- AI model interactions and data retention policies

## Security and compliance

Self-hosting Basedash gives you total control over even the tightest security certifications and regulations. When you self-host, you can achieve compliance with various international and industry-specific security standards:
