> **Note**: This guide assumes you have access to the Distr customer portal. If you haven't received your invite yet, see the [Getting started](/self-hosted/overview#getting-started) section in Overview.

## Deployment methods

Basedash uses [Distr](https://distr.sh/docs/getting-started/what-is-distr/), an enterprise software distribution platform, to manage self-hosted deployments. Choose the deployment method that best fits your infrastructure:

### Agent deployment (recommended)

**Best for**: New server deployments where you want a fully managed, automated deployment experience.

The Distr agent runs in your environment and automatically manages Basedash deployment, updates, and health monitoring.

**How it works**:
- Install the Distr agent on your target server with a single command
- Agent polls the Distr Hub every 5 seconds for deployment instructions
- Automatically pulls container images, deploys via Docker Compose, and reports status
- Provides automatic updates and version management through the Distr portal

**Benefits**:
- **Fully automated** - Agent handles deployment, updates, and rollbacks
- **Health monitoring** - Built-in status reporting and deployment health checks
- **Version control** - Manage versions and deployment schedules via Distr portal
- **Outbound-only connectivity** - No need to expose ports; agent connects outbound to Distr Hub

**Prerequisites**:
- Server with Docker installed
- Outbound HTTPS connectivity to Distr Hub
- Target credentials from Distr portal (targetId and targetSecret)

**Installation**:

1. Log in to your Distr customer portal
2. Navigate to your deployment target
3. Copy the installation command (format: `curl "https://<hub>/api/v1/connect?targetId=<id>&targetSecret=<secret>" | docker compose -f - up -d`)
4. Run the command on your target server
5. Agent will automatically deploy and manage Basedash

**Note**: The targetSecret is shown only once during setup. Store it securely.

### Container deployment

**Best for**: Existing Docker infrastructure where you want manual control or need to deploy Basedash alongside other containers.

Pull container images directly from the Distr registry and deploy using your own docker-compose configuration or orchestration tools.

**How it works**:
- Authenticate to Distr's private OCI-compliant registry using a Personal Access Token (PAT)
- Pull Basedash container images from the registry
- Deploy using provided docker-compose files or author your own
- Manually manage updates by pulling new image versions

**Benefits**:
- **Full control** - You decide when and how to deploy and update
- **Existing workflows** - Integrate with your CI/CD pipelines and deployment automation
- **Flexible** - Works with existing Docker infrastructure and multi-container setups
- **Air-gap compatible** - Pull once, deploy in isolated environments

**Prerequisites**:
- Server with Docker installed
- Personal Access Token from Distr portal
- Network access to data sources

**Installation**:

1. Log in to your Distr customer portal
2. Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT)
3. Authenticate to the Distr registry:
   ```bash
   echo "YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN" | docker login registry.distr.sh --password-stdin -u -
   ```
4. Download the provided docker-compose file or author your own
5. Pull and run Basedash:
   ```bash
   docker compose pull
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   <Tip>
   On initial deployment, run without `-d` to inspect logs in real-time. Configuration errors may prevent the app from running. See the [Configure](/self-hosted/configure) section for setup details.
   </Tip>

**Updates**: Pull new image versions from the registry when you're ready to update:
```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

### Other deployment options

**Kubernetes deployment**
For organizations with existing Kubernetes infrastructure, we provide Helm charts for deployment. Contact our team to discuss your K8s requirements and receive the appropriate Helm charts.

**Air-gapped deployment**
For fully isolated environments with no internet connectivity, we support physical media transfers (USB/secure media) with encrypted updates. Contact our team to set up an air-gapped deployment plan.

## Machine specifications

> **Note**: These specifications assume the target machine is dedicated to running Basedash. If the machine is running other applications, you'll need to allocate additional resources accordingly.

### Minimum requirements

For 1-10 concurrent users:

- **vCPUs**: 2
- **RAM**: 8GB
- **Storage**: 50GB SSD

**Cloud provider options:**
- AWS: t3.large
- GCP: e2-standard-2
- Digital Ocean: 2vCPU/8GB Droplet

### Scaling guidelines

As your team grows, we recommend upgrading to:

- **10-50 users**: 4 vCPUs, 16GB RAM, 100GB SSD
- **50+ users**: 8 vCPUs, 32GB RAM, 200GB+ SSD

### Storage recommendations

- **SSD strongly recommended** for optimal performance
- Plan for approximately 1-5GB per 1,000 charts/dashboards, plus system overhead

### Network requirements

- **Ports**: 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) must be accessible
- **Outbound internet access**: Required for AI features and email delivery
- **Agent deployment**: Outbound HTTPS to Distr Hub required
